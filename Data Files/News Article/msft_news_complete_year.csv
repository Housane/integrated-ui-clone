""But clearly as the focus changes on onto the monetization of AI, from here on you don't want to pay very high multiples and you want to see actually the monetization showing up in earnings. And clearly this is a secular trend...""

10/08/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,"Volatile week for stocks, where investors are buying: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Co-hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills dig into this week's market volatility, from jobless claims data to the yen carry trade unwinding. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are reversing some of the gains made in Thursday's trading session as volatility rocks the market. Edward Jones senior investment strategist Mona Mahajan explains, ""Markets have certainly calmed much more meaningfully over the last couple of days than we saw Monday and Tuesday of this week even... We've seen this week alone the jobless claim figures that came in below expectations provided a little comfort to the market that is really looking for direction on a couple of things. One, is the US labor market headed towards some sort of meaningful collapse or downside, and two, is the broader economy headed towards a downturn as well? And I think for us, both of the answers to both of those questions are no."" The tech sector has been particularly rocked by market volatility this week, yet Goldman Sachs Asset Management fundamental equity managing director Luke Barrs still sees opportunity. ""Selectively, there's great opportunity across the broad market, but specifically in tech as well. There are some transformational themes that are coming through that are driving earnings,"" he explains. He adds, ""When we come to technology, what is very apparent is not just the macroeconomic picture, but also the fact that people want to see... evidence that that gen AI trade is actually driving positive outcomes."" A global market sell-off occurred on Monday after the Bank of Japan hiked interest rates, which unwinded the yen carry trade (JPY=X). TD Securities global head of FX and EM strategy Mark McCormick believes that the carry trade unwind isn't over, explaining, ""The structural nature of the carry trade is that for pretty much around the last decade, Japanese investors have put their money, mostly pension funds, which accounts for about 80% of GDP in other markets. So the assets that they're tracking in other markets are actually a big form of the carry trade."" Some retail investors used the market sell-off as a buying opportunity. IG Group North America CEO JJ Kinahan notes, ""Every crisis... we've had over the last five years, where retail traders tend to start are two technology names, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT)."" He adds that ""Apple and Microsoft are going to be names that retail trades significantly anyways, but made up a larger percentage of trading on Monday and Tuesday, for sure, as people were looking for places to go buy.""

12/08/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Non-Mag 7 equities are a 'once in a generation opportunity',"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks are aiming to recoup losses in Monday's trading session after last week's global sell-off which significantly impacted the sector. As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

12/08/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,"Why Nvidia, Tesla are betting on AI-powered humanoid robots","A new wave of humanoid robots is threatening to shake up the labor market. Built like humans and fueled by artificial intelligence, the machines are learning to tackle complicated tasks at a rapid rate. The advancement of generative AI is supercharging how quickly humanoids can learn, backed by vast amounts of data and high-powered chips. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has doubled down on its future, building out an ecosystem that enables robotics makers to customize their products. The Isaac robotics platform, which includes generative AI foundation models and tools, allow developers to simulate real- world movements in the digital world, while Nvidias Thor system-on-a-chip (SOC) provides the computing power needed to drive the transformation. Already, Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and others are incorporating humanoids in their work spaces. At a recent shareholder meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the machines had the potential to propel the EV maker into a $25 trillion market cap company. Tesla is looking to capture the market by integrating its Optimus humanoid into factory floors. Musk has said two robots have already been deployed at the companys Fremont, California factory and predicted a few thousandù Optimus robots to be working by 2025. But the company faces plenty of competition. Austin-based Apptronik has already signed partnerships with logistics firm GXO and Mercedes-Benz to deploy its humanoids to their floors, while Amazon has begun using Agilitys Digit robot in its test facility.

To discuss the potential impact of the semiconductor giant's results on the broader tech sector (XLK), Bernstein Internet Equity Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Morning Brief. Shmulik notes that when it comes to the AI trade, tech giants have made it clear that ""the risk of underinvesting is much higher than the risk of overinvesting."" He believes that ""so long as that momentum continues,"" the entire tech sector stands to benefit. Regarding tech valuations, Shmulik observes they have cooled and ""are not demanding."" However, he emphasizes that companies must ""deliver on the core business ahead of you today"" to fund their ongoing AI investments. Notably, with companies like Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) beginning to see returns on their AI investments, Shmulik points out that ""it's no longer talk of a theoretical, it's actually showing up in the numbers."" When it comes to investment opportunities in the AI space, Shmulik highlights Meta (META) as ""one of the cleaner names"" for those looking to participate in the AI trade.

28/08/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Analyst says this company can see near-term AI returns,"The tech sector is in focus as leading AI company Nvidia (NVDA) prepares to report earnings on Wednesday. With expectations around AI growing throughout the tech sector, investors are eager to see when companies will begin to see returns on their investments. RBC Capital Markets managing director of software equity research Rishi Jaluri joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on the tech sector and AI expectations. Jaluria believes seeing near-term returns on AI investments will be ""really tricky."" However, he argues it's better for these companies to overinvest rather than underinvest, stating, ""This is truly a generational technological shift,"" and emphasizing that investors must have patience. Despite the general caution, Jaluria identifies only one company he believes will significantly monetize generative AI over the next twelve months: Microsoft (MSFT). He outlines three key factors necessary for Microsoft to see AI growth. First, the company needs to show investors acceleration or what AI could look like within the Azure business without capacity constraints. Second, other software companies need to develop AI modules, as Microsoft stands to benefit from this ecosystem growth. Finally, Jaluria emphasizes the importance of ""actual usage and adoption of AI in Microsoft's portfolio outside of the Azure line.""

""With every economic cycle, as we come out of an economic cycle, coincidentally, there's always a new tech cycle that also goes with it,"" Rangan tells Yahoo Finance. He explains that after the 2008 recession, tech companies came out with cloud products, which eventually became ""the catalyzing force for the tech industry."" He notes that for real growth, there needs to be innovation alongside economic improvement: ""It's not as easy as saying lower rates are good. I mean, they're kind of the first lift. It's the primer. The next thing, it has to be followed by real innovation."" At this moment for tech, he believes ""this game is about capital."" Cloud, just like AI, was ""capital-intensive,"" Rangan explains, and if companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) hadn't listened to investors, he argues that they wouldn't have the massive cloud businesses they have today. He adds, ""Now we're augmenting human capital, I don't know, $20, $30 trillion? That installed base of human capital is far more valuable. That's cognition capital than compute capital.

10/09/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Goldman Sachs analyst on what Fed rate cuts mean for Big Tech,"Goldman Sachs managing director Kash Rangan sits down with Brian Sozzi and Madison Mills at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia & Technology Conference to discuss the top themes in tech and the sector's overall outlook. Rangan argues that there are three important things for software companies at this juncture: interest rates, the election, and generative AI. He notes that the Federal Reserve will likely initiate a 25-basis-point cut at its September meeting, and will likely total between 325 and 350 basis points by the end of its easing cycle. Easing rates will bring down the cost of capital for businesses, and will serve as a ""tailwind for existing customers to expand their deployments."" ""With every economic cycle, as we come out of an economic cycle, coincidentally, there's always a new tech cycle that also goes with it,"" Rangan tells Yahoo Finance. He explains that after the 2008 recession, tech companies came out with cloud products, which eventually became ""the catalyzing force for the tech industry."" He notes that for real growth, there needs to be innovation alongside economic improvement: ""It's not as easy as saying lower rates are good. I mean, they're kind of the first lift. It's the primer. The next thing, it has to be followed by real innovation."" Rangan adds that after the 2024 presidential election in November, there will be less uncertainty: ""It's not important to nail what the new policies are going to be, but it's more important to have less uncertainty and more certainty about what those policies are,"" he says, which indicates companies may move forward with projects it put on the backburner during peak uncertainty. Finally, Rangan believes generative AI will be a long-term theme for the tech sector. ""I am very bullish how it unfolds eventually in the long term. But if you're looking for proof points today, there's a scattering of proof points, but not enough to get conviction that this is going to be a thing in '25 or '26.""

10/09/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Nvidia's sell-off: Why this analyst is still bullish on the stock,"Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has stumbled as investors grow concerned the AI demand hype may be slowing. Goldman Sachs lead analyst Toshiya Hari is still bullish on the stock for a couple of reasons. First, he says, ""Demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong,"" adding that it's more than hyperscalers looking to buy Nvidia's chips. Second, he thinks the company's competitive positive is still strong. He also thinks the stock has an attractive valuation and that the sell-off has been overdone. Investors have been increasingly scrutinizing the amount of money Big Tech has been spending on AI without much return on investment so far. Hari agrees that companies ""need monetization for this to be sustainable,"" but he notes hyperscalers are seeing some return on those AI investments. He adds that if a lack of monetization becomes a problem, it will affect many companies, not just Nvidia. Watch the video above to hear what Hari has to say about companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) developing their own chips.

21/09/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Microsoft goes nuclear to power AI data centers: Expert,"Nuclear energy has been a hot topic in investors' minds after Microsoft (MSFT) and Constellation Energy (CEG) announced an agreement to restore a dormant nuclear power plant to power the tech companys AI and cloud data centers. Radiant Energy Group founder and managing director Mark Nelson joins Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to explain how nuclear energy could power the artificial intelligence era. Microsoft wants to restore the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania, known for one of the largest nuclear disasters in the US when one of the plant's two reactors melted down in 1979. A nuclear engineer himself, Nelson explains that the plants other reactor kept going for 40 years. The only reason it closed in 2019 is because fossil fuels were really cheap.ù He says theres a renewed interest in nuclear energy today because we're running out of other energy sources¶ we're running out of power, and we're realizing that if we're going to have everybody buy electric vehicles, we have to be able to charge it from power plants that run all the time.ù Nuclear power plants could help meet the energy-intensive needs of training and running AI, which has brought the utilities sector into focus. Nelson says building new nuclear plants and restoring existing ones could help. The very best American design for a nuclear plant is being built in China over and over again for about four years or so per reactor and about $3 billion. I don't think we're going to meet China's prices for building our reactors, but we could probably do a lot better building our reactors if we do it in series with the same design, the same plant layout, and we do it over and over,"" the expert tells Yahoo Finance. Fortunately, we've got designs that are licensed and ready to go today at existing nuclear plants that already serve tens of millions of customers. Aand those are the plants that are being approached by the data centers. So I think to get over this hump, we have to accept that we've got outstanding equipment ready to install. We've just forgotten how to do it and we need to do it the same way every time.ù For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

23/09/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Amazon and Alphabet catch up to Microsofts AI lead: Analyst,"Microsoft was among the hot stocks on Yahoo Finance's Trending Tickers page after D.A. Davidson downgraded the tech giant. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) competition among big tech companies. Luria tells Yahoo Finance that Microsoft (MSFT) ""had a big head start because they were involved with OpenAI for a long time. They knew ChatGPT was coming before everybody else. They knew that they were going to commercialize it. So about a year and a half ago, they came out with a whole set of commercial products around AI that gave them a big lead over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) who were both caught flat-footed.ù Since then, Amazon and Google, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)], respectively, have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think that you can start telling that they've caught up, both in terms of the results they've reported and the conversations we're having with industry participants tell us that their capabilities are now comparable to Azure's, thus diminishing the lead.ù Going forward, we think AWS and GCP have an advantage over Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU, something that Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.ù He says, Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia's (NVDA) shareholders. Their over-investment right now creates a point of margin headwind every year they over-invest, meaning Microsoft has to lay off 10,000 people just to keep its margins flat because of how much it's over-investing in building this infrastructure, using the most expensive chips, which are Nvidia GPUs.ù I'd say we're just at a point where they both [Nvidia and Microsoft] can't both win. Either Microsoft continues to over-invest in Nvidia GPUs, in which case Nvidia wins, but Microsoft has diminishing margins, or it slows down that rate of investment.ù He says the cooling down of investmentù could lead him to change his view on Microsoft. If they go back to a steady state of investment and expand data centers, but not at this exponential rate, that would take away that margin and headwind and position Microsoft for much faster earnings growth... if Microsoft actually cools off its investment, margins will grow, and they won't really sacrifice any revenue growth.ù For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Adam Kovacevich, Founder & CEO of Chamber of Progress, joins Morning Brief to discuss the growing tension within Big Tech. Kovacevich notes that Google is expanding in the cloud computing space, aiming to compete with industry leaders like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft. He explains that Google's focus on Microsoft stems from contractual terms that ""lock in customers and make it difficult for competitors to gain traction."" However, he points out that this is ""not a new issue"" for Microsoft, nor is it the first time such concerns have been raised in the EU. ""This is a cold war that's gone hot between Google and Microsoft,"" Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance, noting that Microsoft has taken similar action against Google in the United States. He adds, ""I think one of the things you see here is Google punching back and saying 'look, Microsoft's contracts lock in cloud customers in the same way.'"" However, cloud computing does not have the same regulatory standards as other tech areas. ""This will be an interesting test of whether antitrust enforcers feel inclined to roll up their sleeves and take a closer look at the cloud computing market, which they haven't done to date,"" Kovacevich states.

10/10/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Microsofts venture capital firm searches for next OpenAI,"Microsoft (MSFT) is on the hunt for the next big artificial intelligence (AI) company. Michael Stewart, a managing partner at M12, Microsofts venture capital fund, sits down with Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss what the fund is looking for in its next big AI investment. Stewart says, We're looking at this from a long-term point of view because we are investing in startups that could take some number of years to grow into their business plans and I think reveal the technology's promise, which is the basis of the excitement of so many investors and also entrepreneurs entering this space.ù He explains Microsoft if looking for the real deal in its AI venture capital investments. We are absolutely not looking for a pastiche of AI on top of a company we've all seen before. We apply a strategic lens to every new company we look at.ù M12 seeks companies creating value and doing something useful for the customer,ù Stewart says, noting, There's four real factors that we analyze, and they're called the four Ds: Data, dividends, distribution, and delight.ù Data really is the ingredient that makes the application or the service unique here. And paying off for the customer. If you're an entrepreneur and a team and you're not speaking to those two pieces, the data that you're using to stay different and the results that you give back to the customer, it's really like those two steps are the ones that entrepreneurs should focus on the most.ù Beyond that, getting to the customer, the distribution piece is where we have an advantage. Investing on behalf of Microsoft in startups [that] could reach these enterprise customers that are oftentimes inundated, flooded with so many new signals, [and] so many companies arriving in the space. We want to help use Microsoft as a partner in the future to reach those customers under the guardrail, safety, and reputation that Microsoft brings as a partner to them.ù The last is really delight, and that's that's kind of a qualitative factor that we think about. But it's just the excitement that someone feels in using a new service. It can touch different kinds of AI startups differently, but it's certainly something that it's your voluntary choice to use an application [and] to work with a company because there is so much choice. We're looking at something like 10,000 new AI startups created over the last two years. In that kind of environment, you've got to have customer enthusiasm and love as a key piece of it. That's not always technological. It could be something of a matter of taste.ù Stewart says, The faster an entrepreneur comes to that realization and thinks about the unit economics, communicates it to investors, and realizes it in a business plan, the more likely you'll create one of the lasting companies of the future, one of the new top technology giants of the future.ù To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm joins Market Domination to discuss this energy transition and its implications. Granholm explains that AI data centers are still in their building phase, and it's ""not going to happen overnight."" She notes an increase in ""hyperscalers"" entering power purchase agreements with utility companies to ""get them across the finish line."" The Energy Department, she adds, is focused on ensuring these data centers are powered by clean energy as the transition progresses. Highlighting the potential of SMRs, Granholm explains, ""Those are able to... be virtually connected to a data center to be able to power that center with clean baseload power, not intermittent power,"" adding she is ""excited about this movement."" However, she acknowledges the challenge of widespread SMR adoption, noting that tech companies need an ""nth of a kind experience,"" explaining, ""nobody wants to be the one to buy the first one."" ""If all of these tech companies kind of band together and not ask for different designs, different specifications, but if they can agree on basic power, then you can order a six pack or a 12 pack of these small modular reactors and be able to power your data centers,"" Granholm states, noting rising interest from Big Tech in these reactors to be able to ""bring their own power with them.""

Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, joins Morning Brief to discuss what these results mean for the rest of the Magnificent Seven earnings and overall market leadership heading into 2025. Yoshioka explains that there is a greater emphasis on tech sector earnings given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and weight within the Magnificent Seven. However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters."" With AI still being early in its development, Yoshioka argues that it's ""going to be a while"" before seeing real competition among hyperscalers and chip companies.

24/10/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,What do Tesla and IBM earnings signal about Big Tech next week?,"IBM (IBM) shares are under pressure after releasing mixed third quarter results showing artificial intelligence (AI) and software growth with weakness in other areas. Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off Magnificent Sevenù earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBMs earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated ¶ It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.ù While IBMs mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being kind of clumped intoù the Magnificent Seven group. Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.ù He notes that the positive reaction to Teslas earnings adds to the good momentumù that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have some indicationù of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.ù To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

What are tech investors making of it?,"Tesla (TSLA) was the first member of the Magnificent Seven to report earnings this season, posting mixed results that has sent the stock ripping and roaring by nearly 20% higher. How should investors be looking at the broader tech trade coming off of Tesla's results? ""In the short to medium term, though, it is a trade play. And I think if [Tesla stock] approaches and closes high above a $260, $265 level, I think you buy it because I think it's going all the way to $300,"" EquitySet CEO Tony Zipparro tells Wealth's Alexandra Canal. ""However, if it kind of stops right, pauses, I think it's going all the way down to $200."" Expanding the conversation to rest of the Magnificent Seven, Zipparro views declining revenue and deteriorating consumer fundamentals as the biggest risks for names like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META). Zipparro elaborates on trends in investors rotating out of Big Tech and how investors can remain defensive around volatility fueled by the 2024 election.

Next week, five of the Magnificent Sevenù names  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL)  are reporting quarterly earnings. That's obviously a huge deal, not just for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and related indexes, but also for the S&P 500 (^GSPC),ù the strategist says, noting that the results could feed the debate back and forth between, are we going to get a more cyclical kind of rebound because the economy is stronger or more of that kind of defensive growth trade that we've seen really over the last 18 months.ù On top of continued third quarter earnings results, the market will also get new data that could provide insight into the state of the US economy and the Federal Reserves next move at the November meeting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday with fresh non-farm payroll data on Friday, November 1. Investors will also get the first cut of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2024 on Wednesday. Amid uncertainties, Hill says he does expect markets to go higher.

05/11/2024,00:00:00,MSFT,Constellation Energy's dip is buying opportunity into nuclear: Analyst,"Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) have fallen as much as 12% today in tandem with other nuclear energy names, after government regulators blocked Amazon's (AMZN) power agreement with provider Talen Energy (TLN). CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.† Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech  Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to Americas economic competitiveness and national security cant be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

While the narrow leadership has raised some concerns about concentration and broadening trading themes, Baird Investment strategist Ross Mayfield tells Brad Smith and Madison Mills on Morning Brief that these worries may be overblown. ""It's certainly something we keep an eye on, but I would say that if you had been worried about that concentration or used it as a reason to get out of the market at any point over the last couple of years, it would have been a mistake,"" Mayfield says. The strategist believes investors ""should be celebrating that some of the biggest and most innovative companies are in our markets. Concentration risk, or heavy concentration, has not been a good forward indicator over the last 40 or 50 years based on the data that we've seen."" ""It's something to keep an eye on [as] it maybe makes the market a little bit more fragile to something like Nvidia having a bad stretch run, but it's not something that we worry about too much,"" Mayfield adds.

The second name that clients have been ""buying significantly"" is Microsoft, which Kinahan says is ""not a big surprise"" given ""the fact that it's a darling of retail [investors, it's] usually one of the top three names."" ""The last one on there [is] Reddit and what we've seen there is not only our clients loving it.

03/01/2025,00:00:00,MSFT,Can the Magnificent 7 keep dominating in 2025?,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike ORourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. ORourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""
