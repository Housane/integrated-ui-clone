The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed 52 points lower.  One thing investors were watching was Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. Powell says the Fed needs to see more data showing inflation is slowing before cutting rates.

Hamilton Lane Co-CEO Erik Hirsch tells investors how they can learn to navigate opportunities in the private market, while Hennessy Energy Transition Portfolio Manager Fund Ben Cook explains why he thinks ExxonMobil (XOM) is a better energy sector pick than First Solar (FSLR).

Kessens notes that Exxon beat their production estimates while also outperforming on their ""three larger horses that they're betting on"" for long-term growth. These include their legacy Permian position, the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and their Guyana assets. Kessens states he ""really like[s] what Exxon is doing."" On the other hand, he points out that Chevron experienced ""unplanned downtime"" in their production this quarter, falling short on numerous international operations. With the Hess (HES) acquisition being a significant focus at Chevron, Kessens describes it as ""an overhang"" for the company. ""I think from a business perspective, their best [bet] is to keep their head down, fight through and execute on their existing business, and try to put the Hess acquisition to the side as they focus on that,"" he told Yahoo Finance.

06/08/2024,00:00:00,XOM,Exxon is prepared for resiliency amid energy volatility: CFO,"ExxonMobil (XOM) posted second quarter earnings that topped Wall Street expectations on Friday despite oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) falling to a new seven-month low. ExxonMobil Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells joins Market Domination to break down the oil and gas company's performance amid the current economic backdrop. While coming off record highs last year, Mikells notes that this year, price and margins have fallen back to the 10-year range, which she describes as ""consistent with a still pretty constructive market overall."" ""The work the company has done to improve our underlying earnings power, that's put us in a really good place in terms of just the resiliency of that earnings power through any market environment,"" she adds. In its second quarter, ExxonMobil saw its earnings increase by nearly $1 billion from its last quarter, which Mikells believes ""reflects the decisions that we're making around our portfolio and investments and continuing to drive efficiency across our business."" ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods announced that energy demand should rise 15% between 2024 and 2050, and Mikells expects 2024's demand to top the record-high demand seen in 2023. She notes that the demand is driven largely by countries addressing energy poverty, saying, ""having low-cost, reliable energy is one of the things that really drives economic growth and pulls people out of poverty."" As that demand continues, she anticipates ExxonMobil's refining business to get a boost and the overall industry to address production capacities.

Similarly, the oil and gas company also saw record production in Guyana, contributing to its second quarter earnings growth. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells joins Market Domination to discuss both of these operations and how they play into the overall outlook of the company. ""As we look at the combined now Pioneer-Exxon Mobil Permian operations, we see even more opportunities for synergies there which we're getting out in front of already. And so just as an example, Pioneer has a remote logistics operations that Exxon Mobil has now taken on and added into our remote wells and completions operations in order to drive more synergies across logistics and procurement. We are starting to utilize what is a very large water recycling infrastructure in the Midland Basin that Pioneer brings to the table,"" Mikells says of the merger. She notes that with Pioneer, Exxon has been able to further its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and that there are more opportunities for synergies ahead. Meanwhile, Hess (HES) shareholders approved an acquisition by Chevron (CVX) despite a dispute over Exxon's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's Guyana assets. Mikells explains that the company feels ""really good about the arbitration panel timeline,"" explaining that it is a situation that warrants ""people to take time in order to really inform all the data and all the circumstances to interpret the joint operating agreement."" A hearing is slated toward the end of May in 2025, with a final ruling to come by September 2025. Mikells adds, ""if for some reason we were not successful in affirming the preemption that we have, our expectation would be that the Chevron-Hess transaction would move forward. But in the next breath, I would tell you we feel very good about our position in this arbitration being one of the parties that actually negotiated the agreement that's being discussed in the arbitration.""

A bad economic report, geopolitical event, or central bank decision can swing assets from one direction to another very quickly. One way you can navigate some of that risk is with options.  As All Star Charts chief options strategist Sean McLaughlin explains ""with options you can structure trades in such ways that you know what your risks are going in overnight or into any event or any event specific thing, like an election, for example. You know what your risks are as long as you're comfortable with those risks, you can sleep at night. And we could still position to profit when we get the trades right."" He says the for the next few months, he's using ""defined risk options trades,"" saying ""we could be keeping it very simple. Let's say just like a long call if I'm bullish, perhaps a bull call spread where I buy a slightly out-of-the-money call and sell one further out of the money to lower my costs in both cases, the premium that I pay is the most I can lose.""

Netflix continues to benefit from optimism around new revenue streams, such as its cheaper ad-supported tier and the prolonged trend toward cord-cutting. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil’s stock is being powered by those aforementioned Middle East tensions setting the stage for $100 a barrel oil. Will both of these large-cap stocks keep plowing forward?

09/10/2024,00:00:00,XOM,Why investors should hold energy plays amid Mideast tensions,"Amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — notably between Israel and Iran — oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) have been experiencing fluctuations with an overall upward trend. To explore the implications for the broader energy sector, Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Neal Dingmann shares his insights on Market Domination. Dingmann observes a ""bit more risk-off"" sentiment within the energy sector, noting an increasing bearish attitude among investors towards oil. However, he cautions that if Middle Eastern tensions were to intensify, the impact on oil prices could be ""very quick and quite severe,"" potentially triggering an immediate 10 to 15% surge in prices. Despite this uncertainty, Dingmann advises investors to maintain their positions in energy stocks. ""To me, the reason to hold the group is it's hard to find a sector where you see better shareholder return in the form of bulk dividends and buybacks than you do in the energy stocks these days,"" adding that he is ""cautiously optimistic"" on the sector.

On Market Domination, Tortoise senior portfolio manager and managing director Rob Thummel discusses the valuation of top energy companies while addressing the mantra behind Republican leaders and President-elect Donald Trump's stance on US oil, better known as ""Drill, baby, drill."" ""We have a significant amount of reserves across the US. And so what? Drill, baby drill means to me is that when we need it, we'll be able to drill more and produce more,"" Thummel explains. ""But the goal will be to keep inflation moderated, and keep oil and natural gas prices at moderate levels so that they just don't get out of control."" Thummel also highlights that geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran under a Trump 2.0 administration could put a further strain on oil pricing: “If you sanction Iran then and actually apply the sanctions, you're going to have a basically less oil supply because the result will be lower exports of crude oil from Iran — which basically takes supply off of the market.""
