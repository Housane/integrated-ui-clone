New home sales for the month of May fell over 11%, according to the US Census Bureau. KPMG senior economist Yelena Maleyev claims that it will be a while before the housing sector sees relief, only estimating one interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve by December: ""We've pushed that forecast out into December, so we do expect one rate cut in December, which will help bring overall mortgage rates to perhaps around 6.5 by the end of the year. That's probably not what people who are waiting for those 3% mortgage rates are wanting to hear, but unfortunately, those days are behind us."" She adds that a few more rate cuts in the pipeline could bring mortgage rates to 5.5%. US equity markets have hit record highs in 2024, largely spearheaded by the growth of semiconductor and chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). BlackRock US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs Jay Jacobs sits down with Brad Smith on Wealth! as part of Yahoo Finance's ETF Report to discuss several of BlackRock's notable iShares ETFs in relation to the growing AI landscape and the energy and digital infrastructure demands that come with mass adoption. The number of US households with direct stock ownership increased by 6% between 2019 and 2022, according to a Federal Reserve study of consumer finances. JPMorgan Wealth Management head of self-directed investing Andrea Finan says her biggest tip for beginner investors is to ""find the experts ... Go to credentialized places to get information and learn. I really strive for people to become curious in investing and learn and use the tools..."" Finally, as more than 24 million people are expected to fly out of US airports during the 4th of July weekend, Hopper Lead Economist Hayley Berg gives an overview of thee busy weekend ahead. She explains that summer travel prices have decreased, as airfares are down 18% in the US and hotel and rental car prices remain in line with previous years: ""So those travelers who are getting away are definitely able to expand those travel budgets into things like activities and maybe some nice dinners out rather than spending as much on accommodations and flights.""

03/07/2024,00:00:00,GOOGL,Big Tech-EU regulation battle is 'new chapter in an old movie',"Meta Platforms (META) is under fire by EU regulators who claim the company's ad subscription model is a pay-for-content scheme that requires users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to use for targeted advertising. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as ""gatekeepers."" Meta was identified by the Commission as a ""gatekeeper"" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, ""I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model."" He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a ""slap on the wrist"" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): ""Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500  commonly referred to as the 493  being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

The future of regulation for startups and big businesses rests on the 2024 election, as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have vastly different agendas.

07/08/2024,00:00:00,GOOGL,"Markets eye rebound, Google loses antitrust suit: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the trading day's biggest stories, from the global market sell-off to some of the latest earnings reports. The major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are bouncing back after a three-day sell-off triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July. As investors continue to be wary of a recession, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok notes that despite the weak labor report, there's not much other evidence that points to a recession: ""Daily data for how many people fly on airplanes as of last Friday is still strong. Daily data from OpenTable for how many people go to restaurants is still strong. Weekly data for retail sales from Redbook is also still strong. Hotel occupancy rates, the weekly data also still strong."" He reiterates Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emphasis on the totality of the data, and adds, ""the market is overreacting to just one data point."" Note: Apollo Global Management is Yahoo's parent company. Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist Chris Watling explains, ""Sell-offs tend to happen in waves. So it's not just a straight line down, then we're done. You know, they tend to be three waves or five waves. And in the middle of that, you get these relief rallies. So it's perfectly natural that you have a very aggressive downside, a little bit of short covering, which creates a rally, which is probably what we're in now."" For investors trying to navigate the pullback, he encourages them to ""buy the bounce, trade them for a couple of weeks, go long if you're nimble, but really lighten up if you're if you're sort of multi-month investor. It all depends on your time frames. That's the challenge."" A federal judge found Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google search and advertising business to be in violation of antitrust laws. Presiding over the case levied by the Department of Justice, US District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote ""Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly."" Many experts are speculating whether this ruling over Google's search dominance could impact another tech giant: Apple (AAPL). Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley explains why this antitrust case could hurt the iPhone maker who has a revenue-sharing agreement with Google to make its search engine the default on its smartphones. Meanwhile, new earnings reports hit the market on Tuesday. Shares of Saudi Aramco (2223.SR) are trading higher after the company met second quarter net income expectations and will pay a quarterly dividend totaling $31.1 billion. Shares of Yum! Brands (YUM) are also climbing despite reporting mixed second quarter results. While the KFC and Taco Bell parent missed revenue expectations and saw same-store sales drop in those chains, its earnings topped analyst forecasts. Yum! Brands attributed the weakness to a softening consumer spending environment and Middle East tensions.

As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

To discuss the potential impact of the semiconductor giant's results on the broader tech sector (XLK), Bernstein Internet Equity Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Morning Brief.

He believes that ""so long as that momentum continues,"" the entire tech sector stands to benefit. Regarding tech valuations, Shmulik observes they have cooled and ""are not demanding."" However, he emphasizes that companies must ""deliver on the core business ahead of you today"" to fund their ongoing AI investments. Notably, with companies like Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) beginning to see returns on their AI investments, Shmulik points out that ""it's no longer talk of a theoretical, it's actually showing up in the numbers.""

Thill breaks down the situation with the tech giants' AI efforts: ""Microsoft told you a year ago that it would be the fastest business to $10 billion. They haven't said a peep about hitting that target. Microsoft is going to be a $250 billion dollar-plus company. That means it's a low single digit percent of their total revenue. Amazon (AMZN), they don't even break out the number. Google (GOOG, GOOGL), how is the AI product going? Well, there's no financial impact right now. Like, so Salesforce (CRM), they're not selling AI.

In the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, Spear Invest Founder and Chief Investment Officer Ivana Delevska shares which she thinks is worth buying and which one investors may want to avoid. Delevska says Nvidia is the stock to buy. She thinks the cycle for the company's Hopper line has been stronger than expected and that its upcoming Blackwell line is selling well. Delevska also notes that companies aren't just updating old systems but creating new ones for their AI products, which benefits Nvidia. Alphabet is the stock Delevska says investors may want to say goodbye to. She argues that its search business is ""under attack"" from AI and that overall AI competition is heating up. She also thinks the antitrust concerns will continue to weigh on the company's current businesses as well as potentially hamper the tech giant's ability to expand via acquisitions.† For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Goldman Sachs Senior Equity Research Analyst Eric Sheridan joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook on the digital consumer. Sheridan notes that when it comes to the digital consumer, there isn't a ""black and white"" answer regarding the health of this segment. While acknowledging that consumer spending is slowing, Sheridan doesn't believe the economy is ""hurtling towards any kind of recession in terms of the digital consumer and the digital economy."" Regarding AI return on investment, Sheridan observes that cloud computing companies are seeing the most direct returns on AI spend. However, he notes that it will take longer to see returns in the consumer landscape. ""Most consumers have the same internet habits today that they had 18-24 months ago around the time that ChatGPT exploded,"" he states. Sheridan explains that it takes time for consumers to adjust their computing habits. So while enterprises are seeing immediate returns, it is normal for consumer adoption to lag behind.

10/09/2024,00:00:00,GOOGL,Goldman Sachs analyst on what Fed rate cuts mean for Big Tech,"Goldman Sachs managing director Kash Rangan sits down with Brian Sozzi and Madison Mills at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia & Technology Conference to discuss the top themes in tech and the sector's overall outlook. Rangan argues that there are three important things for software companies at this juncture: interest rates, the election, and generative AI. He notes that the Federal Reserve will likely initiate a 25-basis-point cut at its September meeting, and will likely total between 325 and 350 basis points by the end of its easing cycle. Easing rates will bring down the cost of capital for businesses, and will serve as a ""tailwind for existing customers to expand their deployments."" ""With every economic cycle, as we come out of an economic cycle, coincidentally, there's always a new tech cycle that also goes with it,"" Rangan tells Yahoo Finance. He explains that after the 2008 recession, tech companies came out with cloud products, which eventually became ""the catalyzing force for the tech industry."" He notes that for real growth, there needs to be innovation alongside economic improvement: ""It's not as easy as saying lower rates are good. I mean, they're kind of the first lift. It's the primer. The next thing, it has to be followed by real innovation."" Rangan adds that after the 2024 presidential election in November, there will be less uncertainty: ""It's not important to nail what the new policies are going to be, but it's more important to have less uncertainty and more certainty about what those policies are,"" he says, which indicates companies may move forward with projects it put on the backburner during peak uncertainty. Finally, Rangan believes generative AI will be a long-term theme for the tech sector. ""I am very bullish how it unfolds eventually in the long term. But if you're looking for proof points today, there's a scattering of proof points, but not enough to get conviction that this is going to be a thing in '25 or '26.""

After a judge ruled Google's search engine to be ""monopolistic"" last month, this latest suit has Justice officials focusing on Google's advertising businesses. Cornell Law School professor of law and economics George Alan Hay sits down with the Catalysts team to discuss the details of the trial. ""Most of the time the remedies are 'don't do this anymore.' So, for example, in the early Google case, a lot turned on contracts between Google and Apple and other producers. And clearly what's going to happen, at the very least is, those contracts are going to have to be unwound,"" Hay, the former chief economist for the DOJ Antitrust Division, tells Yahoo Finance. ""The contracts gave a Google default placement on the browser. So there's some behavior, some behavior that Google has to have engaged in to try to prevent competition from coming in."" Hay finds antitrust crackdowns on Big Tech to almost be the new norm: About five years ago, ""the antitrust community more or less woke up to the fact that, 'wait a minute, we've got these huge platforms out here that really [we] haven't been taking a closer look at from an antitrust perspective.""

10/09/2024,00:00:00,GOOGL,"EU cracks down on Big Tech with fines to Apple, Google","Apple (AAPL) has suffered a significant setback, losing a longfought legal battle with European Commission regulators over its tax practices in Ireland. The European Union's top court has ordered the tech giant to pay nearly Ç¨13 billion euros (equivalent to $14.3 billion in USD) in back taxes to Ireland. This landmark ruling comes just after Apple's launch of its new iPhone 16 lineup on Monday, September 9. Additionally, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) lost an antitrust battle in the EU for prioritizing it's own price comparison shopping services against it's competitors. This resulted in a Ç¨2.4 billion euro ($2.64 billion) fine. To discuss the potential impact of this decision on the tech giants, Needham senior media and internet analyst Laura Martin joins Morning Brief. Martin suggests that the EU's actions against tech giants are motivated by a desire to generate revenue from their activities within the region to support its economies, dubbing it as ""the hidden agenda of the EU."" Martin criticizes Apple's previous tax strategy, calling it ""a fool's errand"" that the company operated without paying taxes in the region, adding that ""now the EU has nothing to lose."" The EU now is ""just going to fine these large companies in order to pay for their social programs,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

On the other hand, Google says that all online advertising, including streaming, social media, and others, is one big market. This argument could allow Google to name Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), among other big tech companies, as competitors in the space, making it easier to say there is competition within the space.

23/09/2024,00:00:00,GOOGL,Amazon and Alphabet catch up to Microsofts AI lead: Analyst,"Microsoft was among the hot stocks on Yahoo Finance's Trending Tickers page after D.A. Davidson downgraded the tech giant. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) competition among big tech companies. Luria tells Yahoo Finance that Microsoft (MSFT) ""had a big head start because they were involved with OpenAI for a long time. They knew ChatGPT was coming before everybody else. They knew that they were going to commercialize it. So about a year and a half ago, they came out with a whole set of commercial products around AI that gave them a big lead over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) who were both caught flat-footed.ù Since then, Amazon and Google, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)], respectively, have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think that you can start telling that they've caught up, both in terms of the results they've reported and the conversations we're having with industry participants tell us that their capabilities are now comparable to Azure's, thus diminishing the lead.ù Going forward, we think AWS and GCP have an advantage over Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU, something that Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips.ù He says, Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia's (NVDA) shareholders. Their over-investment right now creates a point of margin headwind every year they over-invest, meaning Microsoft has to lay off 10,000 people just to keep its margins flat because of how much it's over-investing in building this infrastructure, using the most expensive chips, which are Nvidia GPUs.ù I'd say we're just at a point where they both [Nvidia and Microsoft] can't both win. Either Microsoft continues to over-invest in Nvidia GPUs, in which case Nvidia wins, but Microsoft has diminishing margins, or it slows down that rate of investment.ù He says the cooling down of investmentù could lead him to change his view on Microsoft. If they go back to a steady state of investment and expand data centers, but not at this exponential rate, that would take away that margin and headwind and position Microsoft for much faster earnings growth... if Microsoft actually cools off its investment, margins will grow, and they won't really sacrifice any revenue growth.ù For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Kovacevich notes that Google is expanding in the cloud computing space, aiming to compete with industry leaders like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft.

However, he points out that this is ""not a new issue"" for Microsoft, nor is it the first time such concerns have been raised in the EU. ""This is a cold war that's gone hot between Google and Microsoft,"" Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance, noting that Microsoft has taken similar action against Google in the United States.

09/10/2024,00:00:00,GOOGL,DOJ proposes remedies to curb Google's online search dominance,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) is weighing potential sanctions against Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that could force a breakup of the company and dismantle the tech giant's dominance of the online search market. This comes months after a federal judge ruled that Google violated antitrust law with its search engine, labeling it as a monopolist. The DOJ proposes several remedies, all aimed at ensuring that Google does not pose future harm through its alleged monopolistic behavior. First, the DOJ wants to limit or end the contracts that place Google as the default provider on internet-connected devices in places such as browsers, apps, and AI search tools. DOJ officials also propose that websites should be able to opt out of having Google sweep them for information. This would prevent Google from continuing to bolster its index and give more of its competitors an opportunity in web content. Finally, the DOJ is looking to target Google's search text advertising by potentially licensing its advertising feed. Other proposals include going after Google Chrome, the Play Store, and Android. Google posted a response to the DOJ's proposals, calling it ""radical and sweeping,"" and arguing that it risks ""hurting consumers, businesses, and developers."" The company added, ""We believe that todays blueprint goes well beyond the legal scope of the Courts decision about Search distribution contracts."" Yahoo Finance Senior Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan examines the framework proposed by the DOJ as the trial moves forward in the remedies phase and how it may impact the broader tech sector.

New York University Law Professor Harry First joins Market Domination to discuss the likelihood of these remedies being implemented. First suggests that ""the odds are medium"" for the judge to rule in favor of breaking up the tech giant, noting there are ""several hurdles"" to overcome, outlining three big steps: First, the government plaintiffs ""have to actually ask"" for a break-up; second, the judge trying the case must agree, though First notes the judge will likely be ""cautious""; and finally, the judge will need to convince a court of appeals to support such a decision. The discussion draws parallels between this case and a similar antitrust suit filed levied against Microsoft (MSFT) in 2000, with First providing detailed insights.

Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, joins Morning Brief to discuss what these results mean for the rest of the Magnificent Seven earnings and overall market leadership heading into 2025. Yoshioka explains that there is a greater emphasis on tech sector earnings given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and weight within the Magnificent Seven. However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters."" With AI still being early in its development, Yoshioka argues that it's ""going to be a while"" before seeing real competition among hyperscalers and chip companies.

24/10/2024,00:00:00,GOOGL,What do Tesla and IBM earnings signal about Big Tech next week?,"IBM (IBM) shares are under pressure after releasing mixed third quarter results showing artificial intelligence (AI) and software growth with weakness in other areas. Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off Magnificent Sevenù earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBMs earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated ¶ It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.ù While IBMs mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being kind of clumped intoù the Magnificent Seven group. Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.ù He notes that the positive reaction to Teslas earnings adds to the good momentumù that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have some indicationù of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.ù To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues  especially in the antitrust arena  for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.† Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech  Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to Americas economic competitiveness and national security cant be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

03/01/2025,00:00:00,GOOGL,Can the Magnificent 7 keep dominating in 2025?,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike ORourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. ORourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

CNET technology reporter Abrar Al-Heeti joins Brad Smith on Wealth to discuss what users should expect as a TikTok ban looms. ""Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,"" Al-Heeti explains. ""Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable."" She notes that Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google will be fined if TikTok and updates are available on their app stores. Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a ""strong TikTok competitor"" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.

These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently, unlike Nvidia GPUs that target training models. Groqs last capital raise was in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from the likes of BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The companys valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidias more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion, according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. At the helm of Groq is founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. While at Google (GOOG), Ross designed the custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Ross to discuss his future plans for Groq. Ross is fresh off a trip with other key tech executives to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump in forging a deeper tech relationship with the country.
