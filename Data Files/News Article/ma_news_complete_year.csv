16/08/2024,00:00:00,MA,Retail trends are returning to a 'new normal': Economist,"July's retail sales came in higher than expected, highlighting a resilient consumer as inflation continues to pressure households across the US. Mastercard Economics Institute chief economist Michelle Meyer joins Market Domination to break down the state of consumer spending and some of the categories seeing the most growth. Meyer notes strong growth in the e-commerce world, pointing to an 8% year-over-year growth in online shopping during the month of July, based on data from the July Mastercard SpendingPulse survey. Online apparel saw some of the biggest growth, increasing 5% from 2023. She adds that consumers have several choices when it comes to their shopping preferences, highlighting time management as a priority alongside their personal finances and budgets constraints. She adds that the narrative around consumer spending has ""always been nuanced."" Toward the end of the pandemic, US consumers were focused on purchasing big-ticket items, and some even turned to purchasing experiences. Meyer explains, ""I think where we're settling now is one which hopefully will feel a little bit more balanced, a bit more normal, a new normal, but maybe a little bit more normal and stable where you don't necessarily have as large of swings across the different sectors."" She points to the growth of online apparel perhaps as a function of back-to-school shopping or launches of appealing items.

Miller notes that bonds (^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX) and equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) will likely benefit from the Fed's cutting cycle. ""We're playing calendar spreads when it comes to commodities, so we're not betting on the direction of commodity prices, but we're trying to earn the storage costs associated with those,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance. ""We're also trying to pick up the differentials between yields in different countries,"" he continues. He highlights borrowing in Switzerland and Japan as good trades and says that his overall strategy is ""to play it as diversified as we can as to where we're picking up our return streams."" He expects the Fed to cut twice this year, with the first cut starting in September. As rates start to ease, he believes that ""high-margin monopolistic type businesses that have really strong tailwinds"" are poised to benefit. He specifically points to the tech sector and names like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) as examples. In addition, he highlights fintech names like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), explaining, ""if you combine inflation with more money coming through the system, combined with taking a little cut off the top of every transaction, those are phenomenal businesses as well.""

16/10/2024,00:00:00,MA,What is post-earnings announcement drift and why it matters,"With the third quarter earnings season underway, Catalyst Funds senior portfolio manager David Miller sits down with Brad Smith on Wealth! to talk about why post-earnings announcement drift is so important to his earnings season strategy. Miller says he looks “for companies where they've demonstrated clear post-earnings announcement drift.” Post-earnings announcement drift, or PEAD, is the tendency of a stock to drift in the direction of earnings for a period after the results are announced. PEAD is “one of the most powerful anomalies in finance, and basically what it says is that companies that have historically beat earnings in a significant way consistently tend to continue to beat earnings, and their stocks continue to do well. [The] same goes for those that have missed earnings consistently. They continue to do poorly. So [it's] not a surprising concept that winners tend to continue winning and the losers tend to continue losing.” The portfolio manager says there are a few standout companies and industries where a PEAD has consistently occurred in recent quarters. He names the healthcare sector with companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO) climbing on weight loss drug popularity. Miller also highlights the networking space, including Arista Networks (ANET), as well as fintech companies like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).
