13/09/2024,00:00:00,ADBE,"AI spending, Microsoft layoffs: Asking for a Trend","On today's episode of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down the biggest stories and trends from the trading day. Nvidia's (NVDA) latest earnings highlighted a major issue for the AI trade; despite beating earnings expectations, investors were disappointed as they looked for significant returns on massive capital expenditures (CapEx). RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson explains that investors are in a position where they have to put ""blind faith"" into AI players, knowing that it will pay off in the future. He tells Yahoo Finance, ""From my perspective, like we're taking a little bit more of a measured approach, saying, 'Look, $200 billion. Think about what you need to do to maintain operating margins.' Pretty simple math of, like, are we really talking about $300, $400 billion of marginal revenue every single year? Those are big numbers."" Microsoft (MSFT) is cutting about 650 employees from its Xbox gaming unit, the latest move in a string of layoffs that have impacted the video game industry. Wedbush Securities Managing Director, Equity Research Michael Pachter points out that in Microsoft's case, these jobs are redundant, stemming from its acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year. As for the broader industry, he said hiring increased during the pandemic when people were at home playing video games. Now, these companies are ""right-sizing,"" though Pachter thinks they may be cutting too many jobs. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the biggest takeaways from Thursday's trading session. Meanwhile, Market Domination anchor Julie Hyman reviews data from the Federal Reserve Bank of America which found home ownership affordability sentiments to have fallen to an 18-year low, equal to levels last seen in 2006.

13/09/2024,00:00:00,ADBE,Adobe is 'much further along' in AI race than others: Analyst,"Shares of Adobe (ADBE) are falling after the software company's fourth quarter forecast disappointed investors looking for returns on their AI investments. The company, known for its suite of creative programs, topped fiscal third earnings estimates. Wolfe Research managing director and head of software research Alex Zukin joins Morning Brief to dig into the earnings report and how the company stands out among a heated competition. Zukin argues that the investor response to Adobe's fourth quarter outlook is an ""overreaction"": ""I think there are some timing some elements where a few deals that were expected to close in Q4 closed toward the end of Q3. I think if you look back at last year, the guidance for the second half is exactly the same as the guidance was last year. And I think that ultimately, the company will execute and you're going to start to see Adobe as one of the best ways to monetize AI investments... in the enterprise segment."" Zukin expects accelerating growth and improving margins from Adobe moving forward, and despite the weak fourth quarter guidance, he notes that nothing has changed about Adobe's fundamentals. He explains that for AI investments to start generating the profit investors are looking for, Adobe's digital media business needs to see the biggest impact. ""I think that they have a number of different levers to do that with generative credits within the portfolio of Photoshop, Illustrator. I think some of the new launches and innovations are going to be releasing at MAX [Adobe's annual conference] around the video model. I think that that's a pivotal moment to unlock some of that incremental monetization in the enterprise,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. Zukin believes that while all enterprise software companies are ""relatively early"" in their generative AI journeys, Adobe is much further along: ""I would put them almost right behind Microsoft (MSFT) in their ability to actually show real disruptive ROI (return on investment) to those companies where they can understand how adopting generative functionality within their creative workflow really can increase content velocity and content generation capabilities at a much lower price point than they're used to."" He calls this a ""win-win"" situation for Adobe's customers. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Robinhood Financial's head of investment strategy Stephanie Guild joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss her expectations for the market (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC). With rates expected to stay higher for longer than initially anticipated, ""actually keeps a lot of the market in check,"" Guild says. She explains, ""If you have super low rates, it means that there is not much risk to borrowing, and it means that the return that you might put that money in doesn't have to be that high. And so I think it actually keeps a good economy going better if rates are sort of a little bit elevated."" ""It means that cash will still earn a yield ... [and] you can still keep money on the side and have a decent return on it, but I also think that it means that there is still going to be opportunities,"" she says. The strategist notes, ""This is a stock pickers market, and I've been thinking that for a while."" For example, Guild highlights that Adobe's (ADBE) stock is under pressure after its earnings report, which could raise concerns about the tech sector, but Broadcom's (AVGO) results, which were released the following day, sent its stock higher. She explains the market has shifted from ""interest stock correlations were relatively high,"" meaning ""any particular stock would just sort of move with the market,"" to it being company-specific.
