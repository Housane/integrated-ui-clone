26/06/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Nvidia is an 'easy match' for AI investors: Strategist,"The AI trade continues to gain momentum, prompting investors to explore opportunities beyond Nvidia (NVDA). However, identifying promising stocks has proven challenging. Citi head of equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser joins Catalysts to share his insights on the AI trade. Kaiser describes Nvidia's position in the AI trade as an ""easy match,"" noting that some investors purchase this name to ""buy the stocks that are like the pipes of the [AI] system."" Despite Nvidia experiencing a significant sell-off as investors sought to diversify their portfolios, Kaiser observes, ""People said, you know what, let me just go back to the clean and easy AI trade and not try to get cute with these other things."" Addressing concerns about tech concentration in markets, Kaiser explains, ""This is kind of how equity markets behave. Over any 12-month period, you're gonna have forty to fifty percent of returns come from just ten stocks."" He further elaborates on market dynamics, stating, ""There's a theme, a trend, a shift going on in the markets that tend to favor these winners. Momentum does well in those stocks.""

26/06/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Why this ETF fund is reducing its allocation of Nvidia,"Qraft Technologies has decreased its allocation of Nvidia (NVDA) in its AI-enhanced US large-cap ETF (QRFT) from over 6% in May to just 0.7% in June. Qraft Technologies head of AI ETFs Weldon Rice joins Catalysts to discuss the reasons behind the move. Rice reiterates that Qraft is an AI investment technology company that uses AI to select stocks in its portfolios and changes its holdings every month. ""What we've seen over the years with our ETFs, which are now over five years old, is that they tend to sometimes want to take profits in some of these stocks. And Nvidia is one that has had an unbelievable year to date and had a great May. So we feel that the AI model was thinking that it's a great time to take profits,"" he explains.

Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Director & Global Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss major market trends forming around the tech-heavy S&P 500 and the Federal Reserve's interest rate narrative. Newton believes there are ""a lot of reasons to be constructive about the market,"" going on to explain: ""We're heading into a very bullish time of seasonality in election years. July tends to be very, very good, similar to June. I think a lot of investors remain worried about geopolitical risk, about political risk and the fear of growth slowdowns. But the bottom line is, technically, we have over 70% of all Russell 3000 (^RUA) stocks above their 200-day moving averages. That's actually a much healthier sign."" He also anticipates rates will fall along with the dollar: ""I do sense that the data is going to continue to get weaker along the fringes. Inflation should start to fall like a rock. So despite the fact that gas (RB=F) and food prices are high for everybody, you have been seeing some evidence of broad-based inflation starting to come down. And I think that's going to be encouraging, not because a weak economy means stocks are good, more that the Fed's rate cut view will come back into line. And we'll have a little bit more clarity as to when they start cutting rates.""

""If you believe that the hyperscalers are who are going to spend giants amount of money, I should say hyperscalers and the Singaporean government and the Middle Eastern governments are going to spend more money next year on this stuff. Then it's probably a long. If you think that this CapEx could be some sort of slight bubble, it's probably a short. What we think is it's very real, but this stuff is going to take a lot longer to play out than people think."" Green states it could be some of the AI ""incumbents"" that actually come out on top at the end of the long-term adoption timeline.

This one is critically important to this bull market we're on because of the 10 largest names in the S&P 500 generate very large, disproportionate amount of the growth as well."" He adds that this is going to become more challenging into 2025.

He points to middle and high-end consumers who have been keeping the market out of a recession, making Costco (COST) a particularly great investment.

US equity markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) opened Friday's session largely flat, coming off the July 4th holiday and June's jobs data. Nonfarm payrolls rose above expectations for the month of June as the US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported 206,000 new jobs added compared to economist estimates of 190,000. The US unemployment rate ticked up to 4.1%, while many experts were originally forecasting it to hold at 4.0%. A meriprise Financial Vice President of Equity Research Justin Burgin characterizes the data positively, highlighting the job additions and the unemployment numbers and noting that ""it beats what we got last month."" Acting US Secretary of Labor Julie Su joins The Morning Brief to discuss the employment growth seen under the Biden administration, saying, ""If you recall, on this day in 2020, under the last administration, the unemployment rate was nearly 12%, and there was no national strategy to address the economy or the global pandemic."" Secretary Su adds, ""President Biden came in with a national strategy, we've been implementing it, and of course there's more work to do."" Collapsed bitcoin (BTC-USD) exchange Mt. Gox is reportedly beginning to pay back the nearly $9 billion in bitcoin it owes to customers from its 2014 bankruptcy.

Token Bay Capital Founder and Managing Partner Lucy Gazmararian notes that the Mt. Gox repayment event has been ""tracked quite thoroughly in Bitcoin circles"" and was largely ""anticipated."" She suggests that ""any selling [in bitcoin] is likely to be staggered"" rather than occurring all at once. Moreover, she questions whether significant selling will materialize at all, stating, ""people are likely to hold bitcoin for the longer term.""

When it comes to Nvidia, Dusaniwsky explains that investors are shorting ""because it's an overheated stock."" While the run-up has been monumental, he notes that ""it's got to come back to Earth."" He also explains that some investors are shorting the stock ""because it's a hedge to the market. People are shorting Nvidia to hedge their entire portfolio and hedge their tech holdings. So you've got two different types of short selling going on in this name."" Dusaniwsky also points to Apple (AAPL) as a heavily shorted name, explaining that it's not fundamental investing: ""We're looking at a lot of traders that are looking at momentum and technical graphs and saying, 'Hey, I want to short this name. I want to go long this name'... More traders are going and looking at recent activity in the short side and kind of running along with that crowd or getting ahead of the crowd getting out of a name.""

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500  commonly referred to as the 493  being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

25/07/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Chip stock sell-off opens door for long-term plays: Analyst,"Chip stocks continue their sector-wide slide, following a tech sell-off triggered by disappointing reports from some Magnificent 7 companies.  Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Morning Brief to discuss the semiconductor industry's current state. Moorhead observes that due to the chip sector's strong momentum over the past year, ""any hiccup, any rumor of something"" can trigger a stock decline. He suggests this downturn presents an opportunity for investors to identify potential high-growth companies beyond industry giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Intel (INTC). Moorhead advises investors to ""look at a mid-term and even... long-term approach of where those stocks are going or could go,"" highlighting companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM). Regarding industry trends, Moorhead notes that many companies are pivoting towards AI, often at the expense of other initiatives. ""They want their IT groups to pivot to generative AI. And a lot of this is about FOMO, it's the fear of missing out,"" he explains. This shift in focus is creating a divide in the market: ""That's why you see companies that aren't engaged in the generative AI wave are seeing very mixed results.""

09/08/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,"The US economy is slowing, not collapsing: Raymond James CIO","It's been a rollercoaster ride on Wall Street this week. The major stock market indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) closed in positive territory on Thursday after being hit by a three-day sell-off at the beginning of the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped over 680 points while the S&P 500 had its best trading day since January 2023. Raymond James CIO Larry Adam joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the market action and how investors can navigate the pullback. ""What happened over last Friday and then Monday, I think everybody got a little bit premature thinking that this economy was going to roll over into a recession, that the Fed was going to have these emergency cuts, and the reality is that the economy is slowing, but it's not collapsing,"" Adam says of the sell-off. He believes that while the economy will continue to slow, there will not be a recession when the Federal Reserves begins cutting rates. ""I think we've learned over time that the market loves these narratives and you get to see these more extreme moves,"" he adds, thus fundamentals and earnings are more reliable metrics moving forward. As the tech sector (XLK) took a beating this week, Adam believes that Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings will provide key insight into the sustainability of the AI race. ""Our base case is that the AI theme is still very early stages and that it will continue to drive the tech sector for the foreseeable future,"" he explains. He notes that in Wednesday's trading session, mega-cap tech stocks went into oversold conditions, so investors could use dips as good buying opportunities.

09/08/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Navigating sell-offs and a volatile market: Catalysts,"On today's episode of Catalysts, Co-hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills provide key insight into the market volatility and how investors can best navigate it. The number of initial jobless claims filed for the week ending in August 3 fell to 233,000, coming in below the expected 240,000. The cooler-than-expected data is a sign of relief for investors after July's jobs report stoked recession fears and kicked off a three-day global market sell-off. Glenmede Chief of Investment Strategy and Research Jason Pride explains, ""We had a little bit of an economic surprise that people are still, I think, deciphering that employment report. I mean, even today with the jobless claims numbers, people are kind of looking back and questioning, well, how do you reconcile these two?"" Pride explains. Nvidia (NVDA) has fallen from its heights in June as the overall tech sector took a hit in the recent market sell-off. New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban believes that despite concerns around the macro-environment and a potential Blackwell delay, he still expects Nvidia to ""remain dominate in a market that is growing very, very fast."" He adds, ""I think that for 2025... things are fairly well set. You can look at things from multiple angles. We talked about the hyperscalers' cap-ex earlier. We know roughly how much they expect to grow cap-ex. Plans are already set. They already have a plan to train the next generation of the GPT models and the next generation of Gemini models. I think here there's probably limited room for much changes in plans."" Barclays has downgraded the retail sector to Neutral, explaining that promotions suggest ""weakening demand."" Barclays consumer discretionary senior analyst Adrienne Yih explains the reasoning behind the move, saying, ""Last year, it was all about cleaning up the inventory. And so there were a ton of promotions last year, and rightfully so because these companies are trying to get rid of that inventory. We are seeing the same level of promoting now that the companies have clean inventory. So what that basically means is they're doing it for an entirely different reason,"" Yih explains. ""They're doing it to drive and stimulate traffic and conversion. And that's clearly an indication that the consumer is very choiceful and pulling back."" The volatility index (^VIX) has made major moves this week, spiking on Monday amid a large global sell-off. Ballast Rock Private Wealth senior wealth advisor and portfolio manager Jim Carroll argues, ""Volatility does create opportunity because if you like the S&P at its July 16th high, then why wouldn't you like it better where it is now? And I think it goes to the timeframe. If you have patience, if you're a long-term investor and if you are blessed to have cash to put to work in an environment like this, these can be seen as opportunities to put some of that money to work for the long run.""

EquitySet CEO Tony Zipparro joins Yahoo Finance to discuss three sectors to watch ahead of the election, including energy, technology, and consumer discretionary. ""If we're looking directly on themes and kind of motifs we can pull out of elections,"" Zipparro says, ""you look for the overlap, the Venn diagram of what is to avoid or consider in either candidates' case. And so when you look at policies¦ you look at domestic¦ and you look at innovation¦ you take those and you can kind of sprinkle it through any sector you want to look for good finds¦ or finds that may be positioned poorly based on what the policy comes to be."" He thinks it makes more sense to pick individual stocks instead of a basket of stocks. In energy, Zipparro's top picks are Chevron (CVX), NextEra Energy (NEE), Dominion Energy (D), and Tesla (TSLA), while some names to avoid are Peabody Energy (BTU) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK). In tech, some names Zipparro says to consider are Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). ""It's really... looking at domestic. Most semis have a large exposure to international supply chain production, manufacturing, something. And so that's where I think you look at innovation because the domestic picture isn't as clear,"" Zipparro notes. In consumer discretionary, Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Columbia Sportswear (COLM), and Yeti (YETI) are among Zipparro's top picks. ""I think it's buying into those that are domestic... or manufacture and produce more in the US,"" Zipparro says.

TD Securities' global head of FX and EM strategy, Mark McCormick, joined Catalysts to provide insight into the carry trade and its effect on the tech sector. McCormick believes the current situation in Japan is ""challenging for tech largely because tech is like premised, particularly on easy money and easy monetary conditions and low interest rates."" He argues for stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) it could be a positive because ""the yen [is] basically rallying because there's a repatriation of capital coming home. And that's causing basically a trigger of interest rates to move higher, particularly real rates.

Morningstar Senior Equity Analyst Matthew Dolgin explains, ""All these companies other than Netflix (NFLX) are continuing to make progress, but they are just not there, not mature."" He adds, ""the difference with them and Netflix, a decade or less ago, is that they have these other legacy businesses that they're managing. And so they're not getting the pass from Wall Street as streaming continues to grow and is not yet a mature or good business necessarily. They're seeing their other business decline, so they need that to turn."" Despite a volatile week on Wall Street, investors still seem to love tech. Semiconductor stocks closed largely in the green, despite Nvidia (NVDA) falling 2.3%. Meanwhile, bond yields are bouncing back after coming under pressure last week. Jared Blikre breaks down his biggest takeaways from the trading week. The phrase ""bad news is good news"" for stocks used to be true, but now good economic news is good news for stocks. Josh Schafer breaks down a chart from Piper Sandler's Michael Kantrowitz taking a look at the impact of economic news on stocks ahead of big economic news out next week, including the CPI report and retail sales. Anduril Industries, a defense tech start-up, raised $1.5 billion, making the company valued at $14 billion, co-led by Founders Fund, which is Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, and Sands Capital. Anduril now joins a small, elite group of high-valued defense companies like Lockheed Martin (LMT). The company's goal is ""to manufacture and produce tens of thousands of autonomous weapons systems addressing the urgent needs of the United States and our allies,"" according to a company press release. Venrock Partner Nick Beim explains, ""I think there's a boom in the global defense industry generally. We've got wars in Europe and the Middle East. China has adopted a very aggressive military posture toward Taiwan and is trying to leapfrog US military capabilities by investing in tech. And so broadly, the defense industry is booming.""

Built like humans and fueled by artificial intelligence, the machines are learning to tackle complicated tasks at a rapid rate. The advancement of generative AI is supercharging how quickly humanoids can learn, backed by vast amounts of data and high-powered chips. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has doubled down on its future, building out an ecosystem that enables robotics makers to customize their products. The Isaac robotics platform, which includes generative AI foundation models and tools, allow developers to simulate real- world movements in the digital world, while Nvidias Thor system-on-a-chip (SOC) provides the computing power needed to drive the transformation. Already, Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and others are incorporating humanoids in their work spaces. At a recent shareholder meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the machines had the potential to propel the EV maker into a $25 trillion market cap company. Tesla is looking to capture the market by integrating its Optimus humanoid into factory floors. Musk has said two robots have already been deployed at the companys Fremont, California factory and predicted a few thousand Optimus robots to be working by 2025. But the company faces plenty of competition. Austin-based Apptronik has already signed partnerships with logistics firm GXO and Mercedes-Benz to deploy its humanoids to their floors, while Amazon has begun using Agilitys Digit robot in its test facility.

12/08/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Chip stocks will regain momentum over AI demand: Analyst,"The chip sector saw a brief recovery last week after a large sell-off, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again leading the charge. Looking forward, chip stocks look to regain momentum after August volatility, but can they capture their previous heights? KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to give insight into the chip sector and how semiconductor stocks may perform as Big Tech leans harder into AI. ""I think if you look at the sell-off over the last several weeks related to the chip sector, maybe more specifically to Nvidia, I think one, you had some concerns about maybe hyper scaler CapEx [capital expenditures] getting to kind of peak levels, but I think those were largely addressed later when you had comments coming out from Microsoft (MSFT) that it's still seeing phenomenal demand on the AI front, and it's actually supply-constrained,"" Vinh says. ""The second factor is there's some concerns out there that its next-generation Blackwell product could be delayed. I wouldn't find that too surprising."" In terms of how the stock may perform, Vinh believes Nvidia will ""beat and raise, we don't think near-term demand is going to be an issue at all.""

12/08/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Non-Mag 7 equities are a 'once in a generation opportunity',"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks are aiming to recoup losses in Monday's trading session after last week's global sell-off which significantly impacted the sector. As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

27/08/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Nvidia investing 'aggressively' in R&D: Analyst explains why,"Wall Street is very focused on Nvidia's (NVDA) upcoming earnings this week, especially given how much weight the tech giant has in the major US indexes (^GSPC, ^DJI, ^IXIC). While earnings paints a bit of the picture, is there more than just revenue that investors should focus on? Stifel managing director & applied technology analyst Ruben Roy shares his insight into what investors should be watching out for from Nvidia's results.  Roy says that given investor expectations, it will need to be a beat-and-raise quarter for the chip giant.  Roy argues there is more than just earnings to look forward to: ""From an R&D perspective, Nvidia is investing quite aggressively. They've accelerated the cadence at which they bring out compute technology to the marketplace. So we've got the H series of GPUs, Hopper 100, Hopper 200 out today. Nvidia you know, widely has talked about the Blackwell series which is coming out."" He follows that up with: ""Just beyond that there's the new architecture that Nvidia announced earlier this year called Reuben that's coming out in 2026, so they're investing. They're investing on new technologies faster than we've ever seen."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

In the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, Spear Invest Founder and Chief Investment Officer Ivana Delevska shares which she thinks is worth buying and which one investors may want to avoid. Delevska says Nvidia is the stock to buy. She thinks the cycle for the company's Hopper line has been stronger than expected and that its upcoming Blackwell line is selling well. Delevska also notes that companies aren't just updating old systems but creating new ones for their AI products, which benefits Nvidia. Alphabet is the stock Delevska says investors may want to say goodbye to. She argues that its search business is ""under attack"" from AI and that overall AI competition is heating up. She also thinks the antitrust concerns will continue to weigh on the company's current businesses as well as potentially hamper the tech giant's ability to expand via acquisitions.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

If Nvidia doesn't live up to the hype, should investors be worried? Miramar Capital Co-Founder and senior portfolio manager Max Wasserman joins Wealth! to give his expert opinion on market expectations around the chip stock. If the Nvidia print is disappointing, Wasserman believes investors are ""going to start reexamining the multiples."" ""They're going to apply for the Microsofts (MSFT) to Apples (AAPL), the Broadcoms (AVGO), and other AI stocks. They're going to think 'Are we too high? Are we too optimistic? Is the valuations just too big for what we're seeing in the growth rate? Did we pull forward too much in the earnings from forward years?'"" Wasserman tells Yahoo Finance, adding: ""So I think if they show you a chink in the armor then people may say 'maybe we need to take a couple of multiples out of points, out of that' and bring the Nasdaq (^IXIC) down a little bit. Long term, AI is definitely a growth engine, but at these multiples, I don't believe there's a lot of room for error here and as investor I'd be cautious going into the print."" Wasserman also weighs in on the implications of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and what it could mean for the US housing market.

BayCrest data found that options trading on Nvidia could move the chip stock 9.9% in either direction, with nearly $300 billion on the line for the chipmaker's market cap. ""Nvidia is... the heaviest volume stock for options out there. There's a lot of noise, people trade in Nvidia like it's like it's a proxy for the S&P [500],"" Boole tells Yahoo Finance. Boole offers trades that he is agreeable with: ""So the trades that I like essentially dovetail with that view where you can sell. I like selling a $115 put that expires this Friday and selling a $140 call that expires this Friday. That's down about 11% on the downside, up 8% if the stock goes higher. That's a big range.

10/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Expect Nvidia's impact on the market to decrease: Strategist,"The first week of September trading took a toll on Nvidia (NVDA) shares, which is currently trying to recover losses, and weighing on the major averages (^DJI, ^GSPC, ^IXIC) as the chip giant struggles to live up to its sky-high expectations. Citigroup head of US equity strategy Scott Chronert joins Morning Brief to discuss Nvidia's outlook and how investors can prepare for a pullback. Chronert notes that while Nvidia is expected to see 40% earnings growth in 2025, its impact on the tech-heavy indexes, particularly the S&P 500, will start to decrease. ""What we're looking at is the pattern over the past 15 months, going back to May of '23, when they first gave us a significant upside surprise and guidance raise. What's happened since then is that they've continued to raise guidance with each quarter, but that stair-step function is decelerating,"" he explains. As Nvidia's guidance lifts continue to decelerate, Chronert argues, ""what this tells us is that it's still a really important stock for index direction. At 6% plus of the index, it's going to be. But in terms of the more significant upside that it's contributed to the S&P, we think that certainly lessens from here."" He adds that when Big Tech and the Magnificent Seven dipped to about in mid-July, he encouraged investors to ""play 'growth' as defensive around concerns of economic weakening."" He calls this strategy ""a pretty good playbook"" as his year-end target for the S&P 500 sits at 5,600. He notes that if the index falls closer to 5,200, ""your risk reward begins to get much more attractive going into the year-end.""

10/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Patience 'could be a virtue' in current market: Strategist,"After last week's tech-heavy sell-off, many investors took the opportunity to buy the dip. Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari joins Catalysts to discuss the current state of the equity market (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) and how investors can best position their portfolios heading into 2025. ""I think you have to take a broader look at where we think the market's going over the next six or seven weeks, just because we're in that seasonally weak time in the market, August through October. I think that the August lows of 5,116 [for the S&P 500] are likely going to be tested again, which means that as a long-term investor, you just need to be a little bit cautious,"" Polcari tells Yahoo Finance. He points to Nvidia (NVDA) as a buying opportunity since shares are down about 25% since its June high. He does not expect the stock to rally back up to its high, but rather, he sees it as ""on sale"" for long-term investors. ""Now, if you're worried about further downside for the broader market and you think it's going to get dragged with it, well then just sit back a little bit and wait. I think, you know, for most of the clients, that's the conversation I'm having, just about being patient, because patience, in this case, could be a virtue,"" he adds. Polcari argues, ""We're at the very infancy stages of AI. I think Nvidia sits at the nexus of this tech revolution that's happening."" He expects more volatility in the stock as the AI race continues. However, in the long term, he views Nvidia as ""a core name and a core portfolio."" As the consumer discretionary sector (XLY) leads the market's charge for a rebound in Tuesday's trading session, Polcari is more bullish on consumer staples (XLP): ""I think we're already seeing consumers run into problems. We're seeing people live on credit cards, and discretionary is just that  it's discretionary spending. Those are wants versus needs. So I would be cautious on that sector at the moment, and I'd be more focused on the staples sector. While it's boring... I think it plays nicely in an environment where you think it's going to be a little bit of a pressure on the broader market and on the consumer.""

10/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Bond investors will do 'very well' in rest of 2024: Strategist,"All eyes are on the Federal Reserve as it gears up for its first interest rate cut at its September meeting. Miller Tabak managing director and equity strategist Matt Maley joins Catalysts to discuss how the current state of the market and how investors can best prepare for the Fed's rate easing cycle. Maley notes that the tech sector, which has led the charge on the market's record gains this year, is now under pressure. ""The biggest narrative in the last six to eight weeks has been that the earnings from the AI phenomenon are not going to broaden out to the degree that people were hoping for this time last year or even six months ago,"" he explains. He highlights that investors are disappointed in names like Nvidia (NVDA) as they seek real returns on their AI plays. However, Maley says that despite the tech sector ""lagging"" in the second half of August, ""It only retraced about two-thirds of its summer decline while the S&P (^GSPC) recovered all of its declines."" He argues, ""you need to have the tech group either rising even if it's lagging for you to see any kind of rotation. If it goes down and the major indices (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) go down, people tend to pull their money out and rotate into cash... So this tech group is going to still be very, very important over the next couple of weeks, and really for the rest of the year."" On the fixed-income side, Maley believes that bond yields (^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX) are ""oversold,"" which indicates that bond prices are being overbought: ""We broke below that 3.8% key support level on the ten-year note. We've seen the two-year note break down in a significant way, well below any kind of trend line, and it's made a lower high and a lower low. On the yield side, that's going down. That means prices are going up, and I think that that key change in trend for the bond market means that bond investors are going to do very well over the rest of this year, again, on a near-term basis."" He explains that the bond market could be in store for a pullback as the Federal Reserve cuts rates. However, he believes the pullback won't last too long because ongoing geopolitical tensions will likely encourage investors to choose safer plays. Maley adds, ""There's no question that our economy, even if we're not going into a recession, it is slowing down. That bodes well for the bond market.""

10/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Stocks aren't in the 'bargain bin' after the pullback: Expert,"US stocks (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are looking to recover after mixed economic data and cooling in August's jobs print last week triggered a sell-off. Gradient Investments senior portfolio manager Jeremy Bryan joins Wealth! to break down the outlook for equities and how investors can best navigate the current state of the market. ""Stocks certainly are not in the bargain bin yet... I can't argue for that at all because we're at elevated valuations still at this point from the S&P 500 as a whole. And we're still up over in the double digits for the year so far, even though we've come down here a little bit,"" Bryan says of the most recent pullback. For investors looking to get into the defense sector, he points to stocks like Northrop Grumman (NOC), L3Harris (LHX), and the RTX Corporation (RTX). He argues, ""Those companies are at reasonable valuations already... they have different trajectories and they should be OK given the current environment."" When it comes to investing in chip stocks, Bryan encourages investors to examine their portfolios and weigh the risks they're willing to take. ""I'm not saying the AI stocks are bad. In fact, we own plenty of them here, but we don't own them to the extent that even the S&P 500 has them. We're underweight Nvidia (NVDA). We're underweight Apple (AAPL),"" he explains. He notes that now may be a good time for investors to take profits from their overexposed positions and reinvest in other areas of the market.

10/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Goldman Sachs analyst on what Fed rate cuts mean for Big Tech,"Goldman Sachs managing director Kash Rangan sits down with Brian Sozzi and Madison Mills at the Goldman Sachs 2024 Communacopia & Technology Conference to discuss the top themes in tech and the sector's overall outlook. Rangan argues that there are three important things for software companies at this juncture: interest rates, the election, and generative AI. He notes that the Federal Reserve will likely initiate a 25-basis-point cut at its September meeting, and will likely total between 325 and 350 basis points by the end of its easing cycle. Easing rates will bring down the cost of capital for businesses, and will serve as a ""tailwind for existing customers to expand their deployments."" ""With every economic cycle, as we come out of an economic cycle, coincidentally, there's always a new tech cycle that also goes with it,"" Rangan tells Yahoo Finance. He explains that after the 2008 recession, tech companies came out with cloud products, which eventually became ""the catalyzing force for the tech industry."" He notes that for real growth, there needs to be innovation alongside economic improvement: ""It's not as easy as saying lower rates are good. I mean, they're kind of the first lift. It's the primer. The next thing, it has to be followed by real innovation."" Rangan adds that after the 2024 presidential election in November, there will be less uncertainty: ""It's not important to nail what the new policies are going to be, but it's more important to have less uncertainty and more certainty about what those policies are,"" he says, which indicates companies may move forward with projects it put on the backburner during peak uncertainty. Finally, Rangan believes generative AI will be a long-term theme for the tech sector. ""I am very bullish how it unfolds eventually in the long term. But if you're looking for proof points today, there's a scattering of proof points, but not enough to get conviction that this is going to be a thing in '25 or '26.""

10/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Nvidia's sell-off: Why this analyst is still bullish on the stock,"Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has stumbled as investors grow concerned the AI demand hype may be slowing. Goldman Sachs lead analyst Toshiya Hari is still bullish on the stock for a couple of reasons. First, he says, ""Demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong,"" adding that it's more than hyperscalers looking to buy Nvidia's chips. Second, he thinks the company's competitive positive is still strong. He also thinks the stock has an attractive valuation and that the sell-off has been overdone. Investors have been increasingly scrutinizing the amount of money Big Tech has been spending on AI without much return on investment so far. Hari agrees that companies ""need monetization for this to be sustainable,"" but he notes hyperscalers are seeing some return on those AI investments. He adds that if a lack of monetization becomes a problem, it will affect many companies, not just Nvidia. Watch the video above to hear what Hari has to say about companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) developing their own chips.

11/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,"Fed eyes new bank regulations, Apple expands ecosystem: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day, from new capital requirement regulations for banks to the Federal Reserve's rate cut path. The Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr outlined revised capital requirement regulations for banks in a speech on Tuesday morning. The policy, named Basel III Endgame, proposes easements on banks' capital holdings while scaling back other requirements. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Jennifer Schonberger explains the Fed's new policy proposal and comments on Barr's speech. Chairman of Whalen Global Advisors Chris Whalen argues that the focus of this regulatory effort should have been on market risks rather than capital. He points out that since the Supreme Court overturned the ""Chevron deference"" doctrine, which previously gave regulatory agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting ambiguous laws, federal regulators are now more ""vulnerable to losing in court"" if banks choose to challenge their decisions legally. After last week's tech-heavy sell-off, many investors took the opportunity to buy the dip. Slatestone Wealth chief market strategist Kenny Polcari points to Nvidia (NVDA) as a buying opportunity as shares are down about 25% since its June high. He does not expect the stock to rally back up to its high, but rather, he sees it as ""on sale"" for long-term investors. ""Now, if you're worried about further downside for the broader market and you think it's going to get dragged with it, well then just sit back a little bit and wait. I think, you know, for most of the clients, that's the conversation I'm having, just about being patient, because patience, in this case, could be a virtue,"" he explains. As Nvidia's (NVDA) stock tumbled in August after failing to meet investors' sky-high earnings expectations, many are now wondering if this is the end of the chip giant's reign over the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Yahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down how the index's leadership may change moving forward and how investors can best navigate the market as the Federal Reserve begins its rate easing cycle. The Biden administration has invested nearly $34 billion in building out domestic semiconductor manufacturing sites in just two years since the CHIPS and Science Act was passed. Former White House CHIPS Coordinator and Duke University professor of business and public policy Aaron ""Ronnie"" Chatterji commends the government's efforts over the past two years, stating ""the government's done a great job"" in attracting investments from major players like Intel (INTC), Samsung (005930.KS), Micron (MU), SK Hynix (000660.KS), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). After Apple (AAPL) held its ""It's Glowtime"" event on Monday, unveiling the new iPhone 16 along with next generation AirPod and Apple Watch devices, Bank of America senior IT hardware analyst Wamsi Mohan explains that the company is ""broadening out the ecosystem,"" highlighting the health and fitness features on the new Apple Watch and AirPods. ""The number of applications that you're seeing is starting to broaden out, which brings in new users into the ecosystem and that's not even including the phone,"" he adds. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down with Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the Federal Reserve's rate cut path. Hatzius believes that a 25-basis-point interest rate cut will be the likely outcome at the September meeting, explaining, ""I think that's more consistent with the data that we've seen since the weaker-than-expected jobs report a month ago."" However, he wouldn't rule out a 50-basis-point cut, arguing that there is a ""solid rationale"" for the larger cut. He explains that the fed funds rate is ""really high,"" the highest among the G10, despite the US making more progress on inflation than other countries in the group. ""So you could certainly make the case that they should be bringing down that rate quickly,"" he explains.

The tech sector's ""earnings numbers are coming through,"" Draho said, highlighting Nvidia's most recent quarterly report, in which he said ""the results were still impressive"" despite the market's reaction. ""Perhaps didn't guide upwards as much as the market has liked in the past,"" he said, adding ""the bar is just so high"" for the chipmaker that ""there's easy scope for disappointment."" Draho said Nvidia's market position is promising, given that demand for its products outpaces supply as UBS expects artificial intelligence (AI) spending to accelerate in the next year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang spoke at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia & Technology Conference, saying there is ""intense"" demand for the company's chips. ""It's not bad owning these kind of companies that have really strong earnings power, really dominant positions"" rather than ""taking either a lot of cyclical risk or getting too defensive in an environment where ultimately we still think it's going to be a soft landing and a relatively good macro environment over the next six to 12 months,"" Draho tells Yahoo Finance.

Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) led the charge for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, climbing more than 8% intraday after comments made by CEO Jensen Huang at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference highlighted continued AI demand. B. Riley Wealth chief market strategist Art Hogan joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the most recent market movement. Hogan explains that this day and week have been ""interesting"" for markets. He explains, ""[This is] the first time that I can remember we've seen an S&P 500 lose and gain 100 points in a single week."" He notes that volatility is typical for September, and believes that markets ""overreacted"" to CPI data. However, as September is also conference season, comments from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang got investors ""excited about AI again,"" taking markets back up. ""I think that when you take a step back and say, if our biggest concern is that today's modestly hotter core CPI number means the Fed's [Federal Reserve] going to go 25 basis points versus 50, that was consensus coming into the day, right? So it just went from 70% to 85% consensus. So I think it's just a major overreaction in what has become an oversold September tape. And I think that the rally in the afternoon probably makes a whole lot more sense,"" Hogan adds. He notes that semiconductors were down about 23% going into Wednesday's trading day, and argues ""it doesn't take much of a push to get investors back and excited about a group that was trading significantly higher than this just two months ago.""

At the 2024 Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology Conference, Yahoo Finance reporter Madison Mills interviewed AWS CEO Matt Garman to break down AWS's chip strategy. Garman acknowledges Nvidia's strong market position, calling it ""a great platform"" with a large customer base. However, he emphasizes that the chip market is vast, with ""potential for multiple options,"" stressing the importance of customer choice. AWS's semiconductors, Inferentia and Trainium, are ""specifically built for AI inference,"" Selipsky explains. These chips offer particular value for small-scale inference tasks, helping customers reduce costs. He also notes that AWS is working on improving these chips to train large language models. ""We think that there's this really large market segment and there's room enough for customers to be using the best product for the use case for a long time,"" Selipsky told Yahoo Finance.

23/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Amazon and Alphabet catch up to Microsofts AI lead: Analyst,"Microsoft was among the hot stocks on Yahoo Finance's Trending Tickers page after D.A. Davidson downgraded the tech giant. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) competition among big tech companies. Luria tells Yahoo Finance that Microsoft (MSFT) ""had a big head start because they were involved with OpenAI for a long time. They knew ChatGPT was coming before everybody else. They knew that they were going to commercialize it. So about a year and a half ago, they came out with a whole set of commercial products around AI that gave them a big lead over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) who were both caught flat-footed. Since then, Amazon and Google, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)], respectively, have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think that you can start telling that they've caught up, both in terms of the results they've reported and the conversations we're having with industry participants tell us that their capabilities are now comparable to Azure's, thus diminishing the lead. Going forward, we think AWS and GCP have an advantage over Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU, something that Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips. He says, Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia's (NVDA) shareholders. Their over-investment right now creates a point of margin headwind every year they over-invest, meaning Microsoft has to lay off 10,000 people just to keep its margins flat because of how much it's over-investing in building this infrastructure, using the most expensive chips, which are Nvidia GPUs. I'd say we're just at a point where they both [Nvidia and Microsoft] can't both win. Either Microsoft continues to over-invest in Nvidia GPUs, in which case Nvidia wins, but Microsoft has diminishing margins, or it slows down that rate of investment. He says the cooling down of investment could lead him to change his view on Microsoft. If they go back to a steady state of investment and expand data centers, but not at this exponential rate, that would take away that margin and headwind and position Microsoft for much faster earnings growth... if Microsoft actually cools off its investment, margins will grow, and they won't really sacrifice any revenue growth.

25/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Hyperscalers will continue to 'aggressively' invest in AI: Analyst,"CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino joins Market Domination to break down the best Big Tech plays for investors. Intel (INTC) unveiled a new pair of AI chips on Tuesday as it seeks to improve its data center business and compete with players like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Zino tells Yahoo Finance, ""Intel will continue to roll out new capabilities, new chip sets, out there in the foreseeable future. But that said, I don't think it necessarily changes anything as far as the Intel story is concerned. That's the fact that this is a company that continues to see its business model under attack."" He notes that AMD has been ""eating market share from Intel"" on the PC and data center front while Nvidia's Blackwell chips rival Intel's CPU business. Zino adds, ""When you kind of look at the CPU industry, it looks like it's really kind of under attack right now as far as where Nvidia where Intel stands at this moment in time."" Thus, he believes the best-case scenario for Intel investors would be a potential acquisition. While Qualcomm (QCOM) has reportedly been in talks about a takeover, he does not believe it will come to fruition: ""I think there's only kind of limited upside in terms of what they could offer out there. Not to mention, I think from a regulatory perspective, I don't think the deal kind of gets anywhere near to being completed."" In the meantime, Zino believes the best Intel can do at this moment is to cut operating expenses and return to positive free cash flow. In addition, he's looking for momentum in its foundry business, hoping it will gain traction from external customers. He adds, ""If you're an Intel investor, you're essentially a value stock at this at this point in time, hoping for improved profitability metrics to kind of get the stock going a little bit."" While AI drove markets to new heights during the first half of the year, the second half of the year has seen many investors grow concerned about returns on AI spending. ""Our view right now is that as far as kind of the mega-cap tech companies out there is concerned, they will continue to spend as long as kind of their business models, their revenue trajectory continues to hold up. And we think that will be the case in terms of cloud spend, in terms of digital ad spend going into 2025, and also kind of the compute trajectory here over the next decade,"" Zino explains. He continues, ""The fact that improving compute metrics over the next couple of years will potentially drive greater AI monetization, new use cases for AI, I think, is a very interesting proposition and a reason why these hyperscalers will need to continue to aggressively invest. So for that reason, we continue to think there is stabilization past 2025."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

25/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,How Nvidia's Blackwell chips can help solve AI's energy problem,"One of the biggest concerns AI players like Nvidia (NVDA) have to contend with is increased energy use. Dion Harris, Nvidia's head of data center product marketing, joins Catalysts to discuss the heightened energy demand and how the energy efficiency of Nvidia's new Blackwell chip. ""Blackwell was purpose-built from the ground up to really make sure it could deliver the most performance and efficiency,"" Harris tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that the Blackwell processor is coupled with the Grace CPU to offer two times more energy efficiency than the standard x86 CPU. He adds, ""And then of course, we also looked at how do they communicate to each other. So we have a proprietary communication protocol called NVLink, which allows GPUs to connect to each other at very high speeds, and that eliminates a lot of the bottlenecks and therefore drives more efficiency."" Thus, Harris explains that the whole system is designed to deliver ""incredible performance"" at 25 times more energy efficiency than Nvidia's previous generation. When it comes to energy, he believes there are two parts of the equation: short-term and long-term. In the short-term, many of Nvidia's customers do not have the means to quickly build efficient data centers. Thus, Blackwell chips provide ""a huge uplift in terms of the productivity they can get out of their existing power assets."" In the long-term, Nvidia is working closely with partners and energy providers to ensure that data centers are being built as efficiently as possible and that grid infrastructure is resilient. ""AI is going to be critical to enabling sort of the next wave of infrastructure. We talk about the grids as one sort of key use case, but it will also play out in manufacturing and aeronautics and a number of heavy industries,"" Harris notes.

Morningstar Equity Analyst of Technology William Kerwin joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on Micron following the beat-and-raise. Kerwin acknowledges that the results ""were nothing short of impressive,"" but notes that this doesn't alter his long-term view on the company. He emphasizes that Micron is currently riding ""a cyclical upswing"" in memory demand, which he expects to continue through 2025. However, he cautions that this dynamic will eventually decelerate, suggesting that the current rally ""is a correction from too much pessimism"" from investors, even as the fundamentals remain robust. ""As much as we liked the print, [and] we like the next four quarters for Micron, we still see long-term cyclicality in the future,"" Kerwin states. He believes this cyclical nature will ultimately weigh on the share price, leading him to maintain a target of $110, despite the stock hitting that milestone on the heels of this earnings report.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,"China's economic stimulus, AI's energy problem: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day. A new World Economic Forum report warns that global long-term growth is at risk due to high worldwide debt and political instability. World Economic Forum Managing Director Saadia Zahidi paints a mixed picture of economist opinions. Most are cautiously optimistic, with 54% saying the economy is ""relatively stable."" However, 37% believe it ""could get a little bit worse,"" while only 9% expect improvement. However, she mentions that economists are particularly upbeat about US growth prospects. The US sports betting industry has exploded in recent years, with platforms like FanDuel leading the charge. As the NFL season kicks off, Peter Jackson, CEO of Flutter (FLUT) (FanDuel's parent company), expresses enthusiasm about Flutter's growth prospects. He projects the North American market to reach a staggering $70 billion, with global markets (excluding the US) reaching $300 billion. The CEO attributes this success to ""the quality"" of FanDuel, which he calls ""the best in the market"" in terms of value and user experience. This edge, he claims, ""is what is enabling us to win"" against competitors. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed at fresh record highs on Tuesday after the announcement of a stimulus package from Chinas central bank. Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick argues that US investors should be rooting for China's economy because if they fail, it will have serious ripple effects on the global economy. ""I think we have to remember how in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, one of the things that helped us dramatically was that the Chinese economy was expanding so rapidly. And as a result, it had spillover effects into the rest of the world. The flip side is if their economy shrinks dramatically, that will also have spillover effects into the rest of the world,"" he explains. Intel (INTC) is under pressure as it navigates a slew of missteps while falling behind names like Nvidia (NVDA) in the heated chip race. Eric Jackson, the founder and president of EMJ Capital argues, I don't see a quick fix here. I don't see a lever to pull, whether it's taking money from Apollo, separating the company into two businesses. Apollo Global Management (APO), which is Yahoo's parent company, has reportedly offered a multibillion-dollar investment in the legacy chipmaker. There have also been reports that the company is considering splitting into two to separate its foundry segment from the rest of its business. All of these roads I see leading to basically a ten-year slog in trying to turn this company around to fix the cultural issues. And unfortunately, that's just I don't see any faster way for Intel, Jackson explains. Meanwhile, one of the biggest concerns AI players like Nvidia (NVDA) have to contend with is increased energy use. Dion Harris, Nvidia's head of data center product marketing, believes there are two parts of the energy equation: short-term and long-term. In the short-term, many of Nvidia's customers do not have the means to quickly build efficient data centers. Thus, its newest Blackwell chips provide ""a huge uplift in terms of the productivity they can get out of their existing power assets."" In the long-term, Nvidia is working closely with partners and energy providers to ensure that data centers are being built as efficiently as possible and that grid infrastructure is resilient. A new report from Bain & Company forecasts substantial growth in the artificial intelligence (AI) product market in the coming years. The firm projects that the market for AI-related hardware and software could expand by 40-50% annually, reaching approximately $990 billion by 2027. Bain & Company identifies three key areas of opportunity driving this growth: the development of larger data centers, enterprise and sovereign AI initiatives, and ongoing improvements in software efficiency and capabilities.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,AI chip memory drives Microns earnings beat,"Micron Technology (MU) reported better-than-expected fourth quarter results. Dan Morgan, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager, joins Market Domination Overtime hosts Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to break down what the report tells investors about the company. Morgan explains, ""It does appear that they are beginning to see a real good benefit from HBM, which, of course, is the high bandwidth memory that's used with the AI chip. So we're coming out of a down cycle. We've had a couple of good quarters. Now we're getting this AI top over the numbers, and it looks like they did gain from that. Looking across Micron's segments, Morgan highlights how important memory driven by AI chip demand supported the earnings beat. ""Smartphones and PCs aren't doing that great,"" the analyst says. ""They're just starting to get out of the hole, and you have other applications, industrial auto, and so forth. And you're right. If you look at DRAM pricing in terms of spot pricing, it's just kind of leveled out...[Micron's] main markets, which are across the board, there's flash memory and there's DRAM chips. Just about everything is still kind of muted, right? It's still trying to get going. So if you were to take out this AI component, the data server space, we probably wouldn't be talking about it because it's just kind of just slowly unthawing."" Morgan says he hopes the company will provide more color about how it expects to gain from Nvidia's (NVDA) new AI chip, Blackwell, which uses its HBM tech. ""It's all going to be about 'how much of a positive effect are you getting this?'"" The analysts indicates his projections are consistent with reports that Micron expects HBM to be sold out this year into next.

27/09/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,"Super Micro Computer DOJ probe, streaming wars: Market Domination","On today's episode of Market Domination, Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down some of the biggest stories from the trading day, from fresh labor market data to the state of the streaming wars. Initial jobless claims (the number of people filing for new unemployment applications) hit a four-month low, according to the latest Labor Department data. Michael Darda, Roth Capital Partners chief economist and macro strategist tells Yahoo Finance, If you look at first-time claims in isolation, it really doesn't look like there's anything wrong with this labor market whatsoever. Unfortunately, that is not the whole story. The latest labor market differential report, which shows the difference between the share of consumers who view jobs as plentiful compared to those who view jobs as hard to get, fell to its lowest reading since March 2021. Darda says the recent decline in the labor market differential would be consistent with the unemployment rate continuing to creep [up], eventually towards 5% and that would throw us back into the recession alarm bell camp. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) are plummeting after a report from the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities. On the other hand, chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC) are rising in sympathy with Micron (MU) after it issued strong first quarter guidance. A new report from Bain & Company forecasts substantial growth in the AI product market in the coming years. The firm projects that the market for AI-related hardware and software could expand by 40-50% annually, reaching approximately $990 billion by 2027. Bain & Company global technology and cloud services practice chairman David Crawford sees three ""broad pockets of growth"" for AI. First, large hyperscalers building out their capabilities are generating ""enormous"" demand. The second pocket for growth lies in enterprise adoption. The third growth area will likely be seen in independent software vendors that build AI capabilities for their products and run them in their own data centers. As the streaming wars heat up, Macquarie US equity research senior media tech analyst Tim Nollen remains Neutral on one of the biggest players: Disney (DIS). Nollen explains that there are several areas that will ""hit Disney's PNL (profit and loss) balance sheet and cash flows over the next couple of years."" However, ESPN direct-to-consumer will be the biggest factor. He calls this ""the largest event in the streaming landscape"" since the launch of Disney+, and believes that offering ESPN direct-to-consumer will likely cause cord-cutting to accelerate. Yet, he remains Neutral on the company until there are clearer projections about the success of ESPN direct-to-consumer.

09/10/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,"Climate risks for housing, office demand rises: Asking for a Trend","On today's episode of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the top stories and key themes from the trading day. As Hurricane Milton barrels toward Florida, First Street and Zillow (Z) are teaming up to create a first-of-its-kind rating system to assess climate risks on for-sale properties. The monitored risks include heat, wind, and most importantly, flooding. First Street head of climate implications Jeremy Porter explains, ""Our mission has always been to quantify and communicate climate risk, and when we first started about eight years ago, there were really very few resources that people had for understanding what their climate risk looked like and the resources that did exist for things like FEMA zones... So what we ended up doing was creating our own hazard models at the property level so people could understand not only what the risk is today, but what the risk is into the future, what the risk is to their specific property, and how that might impact their pocketbooks."" Yahoo Finance Markets and Data Editor Jared Blikre breaks down his top takeaways from the trading day. The market is seeing mixed risk signals as the S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed just shy of a fresh record high on Tuesday while ten-year bond yields (^TNX) closed above 4%. Meanwhile, the risks associated with a no-landing scenario for the US economy have been reignited after September's jobs report came in much hotter than expected. The AI trade has also bounced back, as Nvidia (NVDA) closed close to its record high. The US office market reached an important milestone in the third quarter as the overall availability rate peaked and began declining for the first time in more than five years. JLL CEO of Americas Markets John Gates explains, ""It's been slowly recovering for some time now, maybe even 18 months. We saw an acceleration, though, in the third quarter and some of the statistics start to look pretty good. Total leasing volumes in Q2 and Q3 were about 86% of pre-pandemic levels, which is the highest that it's been."" He identifies New York as a major active market, and also points to the following cities as expanding markets: Dallas, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Phoenix, Arizona; and Atlanta, Georgia. Recession concerns have been prevalent on Wall Street, but key economic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, are not aligning with historical recession trends. Market Domination Anchor Julie Hyman breaks down the details, exploring the relationship between unemployment rates typically seen during recessions and how the current situation differs.

Goldman Sachs managing director Toshiya Hari joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what to expect from the key artificial intelligence (AI) player. The analyst highlights two things that hes keeping in mind heading into the earnings results: the demand environment around Nvidias products and Nvidias strength beyond AI training in inferencing that support the chipmaker's growth is strong and sustainable. First, in terms of the demand profile out there, the environment continues to be very robust. If there is a problem, it's a supply problem, not a demand problem. Hari notes that while hyperscalers like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) have been Nvidias biggest AI customers as they build out AI infrastructure, the customer profile is broadening beyond the hyperscalers into enterprises and also sovereign states. So there is demand across the board there. Secondly, I think there's been this perception historically that Nvidia is very strong in training, yet their competitive position could potentially dilute as we transition to inference¦ [However] Nvidia's growth opportunity set and potentially expand the competitive moat that they have."" The analyst says that Nvidia's ability ""to really innovate across multiple components at ""a 12- [to] 18-month cadence has set it apart from others in the AI space and secured its dominant position. I think it's going to be very difficult, very challenging, and expensive for others to compete head-to-head with Nvidia. While the market seems bullish on Nvidia in the near future, Hari says the big question mark is the outlook for the 2026 calendar year as investors try to gauge if hyperscalers will continue to spend billions on Nvidias chips. Despite Nvidia recently setting a fresh record high, Hari is among analysts who think the stock has more to run. We do expect upside from here ahead of Nvidia's report as hyperscalers announce earnings that could send the stock higher.

05/11/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,How CHIPS Act changes under new admin. could affect the AI trade,"Investors consider how changes in the CHIPS Act would affect the artificial intelligence (AI) trade ahead of the US presidential election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Bokeh Capital Partners founder and CIO Kimberly Forrest joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what to expect from potential changes in the CHIPS Act. Forrest tells Yahoo Finance she doesn't expect the CHIPS Act to end under President Joe Biden's successor, but there will likely be changes. ""I don't think it's going to end, but I do think the rules are probably going to be revised. I think the current administration put a lot of provisions in that may be slowing down the actual building of chip plants and chips. So I think if either one of them wins, they're going to have to look at that and see how quickly they want the CHIPS Act to actually affect the chips being produced in America."" She adds, ""I'm somebody that really believes in the CHIPS Act because so much is created in Taiwan, and I don't think the normal investor, or even especially the normal consumer, doesn't realize where all of the electronics start, which is on the island of Taiwan that is very close to China. And China would really like to own that outright [and] drive what happens in Taiwan."" The strategist highlights Micron (MU), AMD (AMD), and Synopsys (SNPS) as her top AI picks.

Intel has been a fixture in the benchmark index since 1999, but its shares have plummeted nearly 48% throughout 2024. Ritholtz Wealth Management chief market strategist Callie Cox tells Morning Brief that this change will introduce Nvidia to a broader audience. ""Really, most of America knows the Dow, so a lot of America is gonna be introduced or at least have to get a little bit more familiar with Nvidia and all of what Nvidia means in this AI story,"" she notes. However, Cox points out that the Dow is not a market-cap-weighted index, so Nvidia's inclusion will not have the same significant impact as it would on the S&P 500 (^GSPC) or Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). ""I really just think it's a brand thing for Nvidia. Nvidia being able to say they're part of one of the most storied indexes on Wall Street, even if that storied index is less powerful these days,"" she states.

S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith to break down what investors need to know and how it will affect the chipmaker's stock and the index itself. ""In order to add Nvidia, obviously, you had to take something out, and Intel was a difficulty,"" Silverblatt tells Yahoo Finance, explaining that because the index is price-weighted, Intel's low price, relative to others in the index, ""did not have a material impact on the index when it was moving, [and] didn't represent the weighting within the index where we wanted to."" ""Nvidia, on the other hand, even though it is less than the average stock ... does better represent the field and has more of an impact on the index,"" he adds. Silverblatt notes that Sherwin Williams (SHW), which was added to the Dow along with Nvidia, ""has a lot more weight than Nvidia"" because the index is price-weighted.

08/11/2024,00:00:00,NVDA,Nvidia enters the Dow: Why the stock could still double,"The tech stock landscape may look quite different over the next four years with President-elect Donald Trump returning to office. For one, AI regulation of some form will likely have to come from the Trump administration as the fast-moving technology was not clamped down on by the Biden administration. Is that regulation soft or anti-AI innovation? Thats one of the key questions investors will aim to figure out. At the same time, questions will swirl over whether a Trump administration plans to move forward with a breakup of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and possibly, others in big-cap tech. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson. The pair dive into the outlook for market darling Nvidia (NVDA) and AI more broadly in the wake of Donald Trumps historic White House win. Trumps win will also likely have ramifications for the Big Tech companies such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA) that dominate the ""popular Magnificent Seven"" complex. Is there one big name in tech that investors should own over another? Nvidia is also entering the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which may add further gains to the stock Jackson hints.

""There's a number of areas where I think Trump is probably going to have an impact [on the chips sector],"" Rasgon tells Yahoo Finance, explaining ""one is certainly tariffs"" and ""one is the CHIPS Act because it does sound like at least the Republicans maybe have a different vision for what that ought to be."" He adds, ""There's a there's a lot of things that he can do beyond just sort of the general volatility around the economy and everything else, both in the US and globally, that is likely to increase under a Trump administration."" On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the Joe Biden administration's CHIPS Act and proposed a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports. The semiconductor industry is ""one of the most global industries,"" the analyst says. On the prospect that the US can completely decouple from China in the chip sector, he says ""I'll hesitate to use the word impossible, but it's very difficult. But clearly, even from the first Trump term, that was where they were trying to go."" He explains, ""The actions that the Biden administration took, I would say, were more surgical. They went after specific things. They went after high-end AI chips. They went after semiconductor equipment for advanced logic and memory, but they weren't really trying to necessarily blow everything up. It was it was manageable. With Trump, he's more like a bull in a china shop."" Rasgon says Trump's 60% tariffs ""would have massive implications both in and out of semis."" He notes that there wouldn't be ""a lot of direct impact for semis on tariffs"" since most of the chips coming into the US from China are in other products like smartphones and PCs. "" It's almost like a secondary kind of thing, if he puts massive tariffs on to make it up on smartphones and PCs, that's going to raise the price of those products in their end markets, and is that going to reduce demand [which,] will certainly roll down to the semiconductors.""

Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations. Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry. Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options. Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: ""It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software  and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.""

Host Brad Smith. ""Clients are still very much polarized from the election. It's either 'Trump's in, we got to buy,' or it's Trump's in, I'm really anxious, we got to go to cash.'

D.A. Davidson head of technology research Gil Luria breaks down the chipmaker's stock moves during the trading day and explains why he considers himself the ""least bullish"" Wall Street analyst covering Nvidia. ""I like to think of myself as maybe the least bullish of the 60-something analysts that cover Nvidia,"" Luria says. ""The reason is that I think this is a cycle just like any other cycle we've ever seen, which is to say: This may be the peak year of the cycle."" The analyst continues, ""For Nvidia stock to be attractive from here, you would need to believe that it can grow 15, 20% into next year and the year after that. We think that that may not happen."" Luria notes that hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are unlikely to continue spending at their current monumental rate and that sovereign artificial intelligence customers are unlikely to make up for any normalization of Big Tech capital spending.

""I think we peaked in late December,"" Woods explains. ""What I look at is the overall breadth of the market, and the breadth has been very negative."" The strategist elaborates on his outlook for the 2025 economy: ""Equities are going to get jittery, and we're going to sell off a little bit. This is a normal correction in a secular bull market."" He continues, ""Nothing fundamentally has changed, but we're worried about taxes and the implications it has on inflation. We have a new administration coming in; we're not certain how that's going to play out."" Despite the uncertainty, Woods clarifies that what's happening now is not unprecedented, noting that ""10% corrections happen, on average, every 18 months"" and the economy is simply in the midst of that cycle. ""I'm not looking to make headlines by saying we're in the midst of a correction,"" Woods says. ""People see that, and they get a little spooked. I think it's a buying opportunity.""

Aurora CEO Chris Urmson explains ""Nvidia provides a really critical part of our system""  the Aurora Driver system that enables the autonomous vehicles  ""the processor that our algorithms run on."" Nvidia's Drive Thor and DriveOS (operating system) will be integrated into the Aurora Driver system. ""If you're a trucking company today, you're limited to driving that vehicle 11 hours a day because people get tired. With what we're building with the Aurora driver, you should be able to operate that vehicle more like 20 hours a day,"" Urmson further elaborates, adding that this will reduce the dangers of stress and sleep deprivation for long-haul commercial truckers. ""The driver won't get tired. So you can run longer at lower speeds, so you have more fuel economy, which is good for the environment and good for the bottom line. And, of course, while driving a truck is a really important job and we should be thankful for anyone who's willing to do it, there aren't enough people who actually want to do it because it's a tough job.""

24/03/2025,00:00:00,NVDA,Why Nvidia stock is still a must own,"Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has had a month, as one would say. He provided more details on powerful new AI chips, such as Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin at its big annual GTC conference, chips that could help take civilization to a whole other level of productivity. At the same time, he moved to alter the narrative that DeepSeek's advances in AI equaled bad news for demand for Nvidia's chips. And to top it all off, he held a meeting with top quantum computing CEOs to make peace after sending the sector reeling earlier this year. Despite the flurry of headlines, Nvidias stock is still going in reverse. In fact, the stock has been lagging for the entire year. What gives? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with BofA semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya about whats weighing on Nvidias super hot stock, why Arya attended GTC, and shares his firsthand account on what he learned on the ground. Arya is also fresh off upgrading shares of ailing chipmaker Intel (INTC) amid the appointment of a new CEO in Lip-Bu Tan. Sozzi and Arya discuss that big call and the state of the semiconductor industry. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.

There isnt much Pat Gelsinger hasnt done in the tech industry. He created cutting-edge technology decades ago at Intel (INTC). Then went off to VMware to reinvent the tech player. He then returned to Intel several years ago to revive the chip giant. But Gelsingers tenure at Intel was rocky as the company fell behind rivals like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) with AI chips. The company also made a big decision to start making its own chips, which came at a material cost to the bottom line. With results and the stock price under pressure, Gelsinger and Intel parted ways in December 2024. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks with Gelsinger now that he has had some time to reflect on his Intel tenure. Gelsinger has emerged as an investor in startups, taking his experience at Intel and seeking to help the next generation of tech leaders.
