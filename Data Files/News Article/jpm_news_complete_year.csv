JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Carla Hassan joins Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi and Rachelle Akuffo to discuss current trends in wealth management. Hassan highlights the diverse spectrum of investors, ranging from established individuals to those just beginning their wealth-building journey. She emphasizes that JPMorgan's business strategy focuses on ""how [do] we segment who those customers are and how [do] we talk to them?"" The company aims to create tailored products for each individual based on their unique approach to building wealth. ""You can't think about the wealth continuum as just one customer, you have to think about the different phases of their life,"" Hassan stresses. Addressing generational differences in wealth building, Hassan notes an older, established generation who ""understand good financial acumen."" In contrast, she points out ""an entire generation that frankly, when you think about all the misinformation that is out there in the marketplace,"" requires a different approach. JPMorgan aims to position itself as a trusted financial institution that informs and enables this younger generation to make practical decisions regarding their wealth and future. Addressing the evolving digital media landscape and the increasing trend of consumers seeking financial information online, Hassan emphasizes JPMorgan's role as a trustworthy institution. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""It's across the board how people are consuming information and getting information, so for us we think it's a huge opportunity, as a trusted brand, to be able to say here's years and years and years of getting it right.

Sykes expresses a bullish stance on bank earnings, highlighting two key factors that could potentially boost reports. First, he notes that the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 5% increase for the quarter could positively impact asset and wealth management segments in bank earnings. Secondly, Sykes points to ""a slight decline"" in the ten-year yield, which he views as beneficial for operating capital contribution. Overall, Sykes sees ""continued steady progress"" in the banking sector, asserting that ""fundamentally, they're chugging along and in good shape."" Regarding consumer trends supporting big banks, Sykes acknowledges a slowdown among lower-income consumers due to inflation pressures. However, he emphasizes that ""we continue to see pretty strong metrics out of the higher-end"" consumers.

""It's just not a huge contributor to revenues,"" Goldberg explains, though he adds that ""it's certainly something to be mindful of.""

Portales Partners founder and Wall Street Beats partner Charlie Peabody comes on Market Domination to talk about the prevalent themes emerging in bank earnings, such as net interest income figures ""Short term, there's momentum in the capital markets. And so Goldman is a good momentum play, but we argue that their earnings stream remains much more cyclical than the market is valuing them at,"" Peabody states. ""And that's the big debate out there in management as they moved away from their failed consumer banking strategy back to their roots as an investment bank, have been trying to convince the street that there is a core underlying earnings power that's sustainable and stable. And I don't believe them."" Peabody also looks ahead to the bank earnings due out this week, such as Morgan Stanley (MS): ""I think it's going to be more of the same  strong, investment banking with an eye towards a pick up in M&A and IPOs in the second half of the year. And then trading will be driven more by equity trading and less so by fixed income trading.""

KBW managing director David Konrad joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the state of the sector and break down the Fed's latest move. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) President and COO Daniel Pinto believes that analysts may have too rosy of expectations for the bank's net interest income expenses in 2025. Konrad notes that his estimate is below Wall Street's own guidance, and adds, ""What happened this past year is their guidance kept being raised because they're asset sensitive, the forward curve didn't materialize, and the Fed really didn't cut rates yet obviously this year. So their estimates this year beat expectations."" As the Federal Reserve moves into an interest rate easing cycle, Konrad expects ""asset-sensitive"" names like JPMorgan to experience some pressure in its net interest income. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) announced that trading revenue could fall 10% in the third quarter, which Konrad calls ""disappointing."" He notes that trading will be a more volatile number as it faces seasonality and volume issues. He adds, ""We think that's that's a little bit not necessarily a trend line, but a tough quarter there."" With the Fed unveiling new proposed capital requirements, Konrad argues that ""reducing the capital requirements by 50% was kind of in the market a little bit. And that's really basically where it came into."" Fed Vice Chair of Supervision Barr expects capital to rise about 9%, which Konrad says ""feels about right"" and comes in ""largely in-line"" with expectations: ""The Fed typically gold plates the international standards, and then they took it a step further with this proposal. So what ended up happening is you had the US banks holding a lot more capital than the global banks. And so I think this largely adjusts that.""

To discuss the implications of these proposals, Catalysts welcomes Chairman of Whalen Global Advisors Chris Whalen. Whalen argues that the focus of this regulatory effort should have been on market risks rather than capital. He points out that since the Supreme Court overturned the ""Chevron deference"" doctrine, which previously gave regulatory agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting ambiguous laws, federal regulators are now more ""vulnerable to losing in court"" if banks choose to challenge their decisions legally. ""The large banks are not happy seeing a 25% increase in capital [reserves] because they don't need it. These banks are giving back capital to investors every quarter. In fact, they would like to give back more. The banks are under-levered in terms of opportunity,"" Whalen tells Yahoo Finance.

Fundstrat Global Advisors managing director and global head of technical strategy Mark Newton joins Market Domination to discuss market trends and how investors should prepare for the year-end. Big Bank stocks, in particular, are under pressure after the Federal Reserve proposed new capital requirement regulations for banks that would seek easements on their capital holdings while scaling back other requirements. Newtown notes that financials (XLF) are the second-largest sector in the S&P 500 after technology (XLK), and that today's movement is ""a minor pullback."" He highlights that banks have been up about 10% over the last three months, and the pullback is ""on the heels of really robust gains in this sector."" Newton finds the broader market picture to be ""pretty healthy,"" pointing to new all-time highs in technology, financials, healthcare (XLV), industrials (XLI), and utilities (XLU). While the tech sector is under pressure, he believes that it has ""not broken down substantially enough to think that tech is broken."" ""We have this huge amount of contentiousness and divisiveness regarding the election. Of course, two wars overseas. A lot to get us unhappy about. Earnings, though, have been remarkably good, and the stock market itself has been good,"" Newton tells Yahoo Finance. ""So, you know, let's not get too bent out of shape about, granted, some understandable major pullback in some of the semiconductor stocks. I don't think it's been damaging enough to say that the market has peaked out honestly. But it is an uncomfortable time for many investors."" Wall Street is also paying extra close attention to the Federal Reserve as it moves forward with its first interest rate cut, and Newtown anticipates an interest rate cut of 35 basis points. He notes that when the Fed has cut between 25 and 50 basis points historically, it's been ""troublesome."" ""My thinking is the market ends the year probably at 5,800 or higher, and the best times of any election year typically tend to be buying weakness into the election November into next spring really should be the sweet spot for investors. So if you want to make money in this day and age, you know, in this time period between now and the election, you have to be very well diversified,"" Newton says. He recommends the healthcare sector and financials, calling JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM) stock price  currently around $200 per share  a ""steal.""

12/09/2024,00:00:00,JPM,More banking M&A deals expectedHow to play the financial sector,"Market Domination anchors Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton explored how to navigate uncertainty in the financial sector on the Yahoo Finance Playbook. Mendon Capital senior portfolio manager Anton Schutz and Janney Montgomery Scott director of research Chris Marinac joined to discuss recent weakness in JPMorgan (JPM) and Ally Financial (ALLY) stocks as well as expected mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity in the sector. After JPMorgan warned about its net interest income, the stock fell, though Schutz said investors' worries were overblown. The portfolio manager expects the company to beat its guidance given its ""priced for greatness."" Marinac told the Market Domination team that another factor for JPMorgan investors is the timing of upcoming rate cuts. Ahead of expected rate cuts, the banking sector is positioned very well because the cost of funds surged during the last 12 to 18 months, and so as interest rates fall, the cost of funds is going to improve. After comments from the Ally CFO on Tuesday raised concerns about credit quality, Schutz said this dynamic reflects the company's customer base rather than cause for concern about the banking market at large. Ally's just seeing the pressure from having a customer base of subprime consumers, Schutz said. Schutz did note that credit quality is important given that banks' book values, a companys assets versus liabilities, are critical as mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are expected to pick up meaningfully. Marinac added that the expected uptick in M&A deals could come from mid-cap banks consolidating and acquiring regional banks to scale. We absolutely are at an inflection point on M&A, and the question is how much happens now and how much happens in the next six months, Marinac said, highlighting that the stocks haven't yet discounted that positive news, leaving an opportunity for investors. Schutz named First Horizon (FHN) and Veritex (VBTX) among his top picks, while Marinac called out Ameris Bancorp (ABCB), FB Financial (FBK), and Fifth Third (FITB).

07/10/2024,00:00:00,JPM,Big banks kick off Q3 earnings seasonWhat you need to know,"Ahead of big banks like JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), kicking off the third quarter earnings season, Stephen Biggar, Argus Research director of financial services research, joins Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to take a look at the financials sector and what investors can expect. Biggar says the Federal Reserve rate easing cycle benefits the banking sector alongside the rest of the market. As bank analysts, we typically root for higher interest rates because that's better for net interest margins. But there has been a point where these high rates have kind of worn out their welcome. Lower rates here will help stimulate some of the loan growth, which has been very, very weak. That will help take some of the pressure off deposit costs, which have also been elevated for banks. And then also [it] kind of helps with increasing the odds of a soft landing, and that will help with loss provision. So you know that slower economy has produced higher unemployment here to the extent we can take some of that pressure off, we get lower loss provision. So really a triple boom for the for the lending business, if lower rates pan out. Following last weeks better-than-expected September jobs report, the market may be wary that the Fed may put a pause on cutting rates. Biggar says, We have been counting on lower rates and, of course, that is a double-edged sword and... hurts on the net interest margin front. But, you know, to the extent that the banks are pretty well hedged here, [assuming] the economy doesn't fall off a cliff. He adds, Banks are pretty well hedged. And they'll do okay. Loan growth has not turned negative loss provisions have not. You know increased to the point that it's really hurting profitability at this stage. And then you've got the capital markets side which is showing some signs of rebound. So I think you know, all told, the next six months [are] probably better than the last six for banks. Biggar names JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS) as top stock picks in the banking sector going into earnings season.

Citizens JMP director of financial technology research Devin Ryan joins Market Domination to break down what investors can expect from these earnings and his top plays in the sector. After the Federal Reserve delivered a 50-basis-point cut in September, Ryan explains, ""What you earn on your cash on the asset side of the equation is going to come down a little bit. But the flip side is the deposit costs are going to come down as well."" Thus, he points to names like Charles Schwab (SCHW) that are in a position to benefit after underperforming in the last year. ""Even though on one hand, they are going to see a little bit of a lower asset yield on some of their short-term stuff, the longer-term securities are rolling off and they're going to reprice higher,"" Ryan tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, ""And then they have this funding cost dynamic where customer, essentially cash deposits, have been going out the door to money markets. And I think that's going to stop as well."" In addition, Ryan notes that capital markets have been ""very depressed."" As interest rates continue to fall, companies will likely decrease their financing, and in turn, financials could see a rise in M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity. He also points to Goldman Sachs (GS) as another great opportunity, as he is bullish on its alternative asset management business. ""The alternative asset managers trade at 25 times or more on forward earnings. So as that part of their business becomes more meaningful, that's going to move the needle,"" Ryan argues. Ryan highlights Perella Weinberg (PWP) as a small-cap play in the sector. He explains, ""It's a small advisory boutique trading at 13 times our estimate for next year. The peers are over 20 times. So I think they're going to close that valuation gap, so there's a lot of upside still there.""

Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Macrae Sykes joins Catalysts to break down what investors can expect from the bank earnings ahead and how major firms will be impacted by the Federal Reserve's rate-easing cycle. ""I think it should be a pretty good earnings season. We do know that there's going to be some headwinds from NII (net interest income) that's shifting around a little bit. But the S&P financials (^SPSDMUN) is up about 10% for the quarter, so good anticipation of the results. You have the S&P up 6% during the quarter. That's good for wealth and asset management contribution in terms of fee revenue. Deposits up 1%, 4% annualized, so that's supportive of balance sheets. NIMS (net interest margin security), we had this surprise 50-basis-point cut versus 25 in the quarter. That's not really going to be impactful but that gives a good setup for going forward in terms of the net interest margins normalizing and getting better going into '25, '26,"" Sykes tells Yahoo Finance. Thus, he believes that while these earnings will be good for banks, investors will be looking for better acceleration over the next few years as both the consumer and credit are performing well. As the Federal Reserve continues to ease interest rates, Sykes explains that banks that are asset-sensitive, like JPMorgan, will face some pressure when it comes to their balance sheets. While the size and pacing of the Fed's next steps are unknown, Sykes explains, ""I think the banks will react accordingly and that will be a good environment."" He continues, ""And then we've seen the rate curve in general flatten out, so stop the inversion. And I think that's a good path to recovery in terms of managing your liabilities and assets.""

11/10/2024,00:00:00,JPM,JPMorgan to 'lead the pack back up in banks' earnings season,"Big Banks kick off the third-quarter earnings season. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) reported quarterly results showing a surprise gain in net interest income. Whalen Global Advisors chairman Chris Whalen joins Morning Brief Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith to take a look at the banks results and what it means for large-cap financials. Whalen says the net interest income is an illustration of the fact that JP is well managed. Jamie Dimon has managed to his duration, if you will, much better than the other large banks. Having said that, the revenues are down substantially from the second quarter, which was an unusual quarter. They're kind of in line with the first quarter in terms of the top line. Going forward, you're going to see managers go back into the stock because a lot of managers earlier in the year had withdrawn from the large caps, thinking we were headed for a recession, [but] it's not happening. Even though JP has built reserves, [and] reserves are up over 100% year over year, they're still not at a level where you're going to be terribly worried, he says. Overall, JP is going to lead the pack back up as the large caps come back into favor with the managers, Whalen says, noting that in the second quarter, smaller names American Express, Axos, [and] Ameriprise, they all rose to the top¦ I think managers liked the large caps in the first quarter [and] certainly last year, but now, not so much. He adds the big risk to the banking sectors is if we don't get more rate cuts from the Fed, which I think is a likely scenario.

While these banks outperformed expectations, the potential impact of future Federal Reserve rate cuts on these financial giants remains a key concern. Hennessy Funds portfolio manager David Ellison, joins Market Domination to share his outlook on the situation. Ellison notes that, fundamentally, bank earnings aligned with investor expectations. However, he emphasizes a significant shift: ""The mathematics of the business is working in their favor for the first time in a while,"" as banks grow equity, buy back stocks, and see tangible book values increase. Furthermore, he points out that as banks like JPMorgan see their balance sheets expand, ""the banks are becoming a much bigger part of how the Fed is going to fund the government,"" which creates additional value for these major financial institutions. ""Those are the things that I see: the Fed is shrinking, the banks are getting bigger, and because of that, they're becoming more important and more profitable,"" Ellison tells Yahoo Finance.

15/10/2024,00:00:00,JPM,"What to expect from bank earnings: BofA, Citi, Goldman","HSBC head of US financials research Saul Martinez sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss what investors can expect from Big Bank earnings, with Citi (C), Bank of America(BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) set to report this week. With all these banks, the question is: Do we see a trough in net interest income in the second half or in early 2025? And do we start to see growth again in net interest income next year? That's a critical question because if you do start to see net interest income growing, which is the biggest revenue component of banks, you start to get an outlook that allows banks to post positive operating leverage and improving EPS momentum and ROTC momentum, Martinez tells Yahoo Finance. In the case of Bank of America, especially tomorrow, that's a key driver. What they say about net interest income in the fourth quarter and into 2025, and whether they continue to see that improving in 2025 is going to be a really important determinant for how the share price reacts. Given JPMorgans strong investment banking results reported last week, Martinez says hes cautiously optimistic about Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs's upcoming reports. He explains, We favor investment banks over traditional banks. We think the earnings revision cycle, which has been negative for a few years, is inflecting. We think [in] the wealth management business theres some positive signs there in terms of net new fee-generating assets. But the investment banking side is a big piece of that as well. We think they are positively leveraged [for an] improving investment banking cycle. We still think were in the middle innings of that improvement, and that could last a couple of years. Martinez names Goldman and Morgan Stanley as primary beneficiaries. Ahead of Citis quarterly results, Martinez says hell be watching for dynamics that point to a better profitability outlook over the next couple of years, especially given there's a lot of stuff that is in their control expenses.

Goldman Sachs saw investment banking fees rise 20%, or $1.8 billion, from this time last year To speak more on bank earnings, Market Domination welcomes CFRA Director of Equity Research Ken Leon. As financial institutions adjust to the new interest rate environment, Leon forecasts M&A underwriting transactions. He found Citi's earnings performance to be ""a little sluggish."" CFRA has Citi at a Buy rating with a $73 per share price target. ""The intermediate of course, is a streamlined bank, one that's watching expenses. It's rid itself of consumer banks outside the US, and it has still a pretty significant institutional treasury service business,"" Leon tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton. ""It wasn't good enough today, and I think part of this was the messaging from senior management that still talks about a multiyear transformation.""

16/10/2024,00:00:00,JPM,2 reasons why investment banking activity is up this quarter,"Major US banks have all reported their earnings. Morgan Stanley (MS) closed out the group, topping analysts' expectations and delivering a big boost in investment banking revenue. American Banker editor-in-chief Chana Schoenberger joins Catalysts to discuss Big Bank earnings and her major takeaways from the industry. Schoenberger's biggest takeaway from bank earnings is that ""investment banking is up and trading is up."" She attributes this trend to two factors: the markets being up and an increase in dealmaking. She notes that M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity has increased this year and will continue its momentum as interest rates fall. While easing interest rates is usually bad news for banks, she notes that it's not all negative: ""When deposits come, in they have to pay money. They have to pay interest to their depositors. But then they also get to keep that spread. So a low [interest] rate environment should generally mean that things pick up in the economy and that is very good for banks.""

17/10/2024,00:00:00,JPM,What's the next M&A catalyst as investment banking activity rises?,"Morgan Stanley (MS) capped off third quarter earnings season for major banks, topping estimates and driving dealmaking fees higher by 56% to $1.4 billion. This earnings cycle has noted a rebound in dealmaking activity from top investment banks, particularly in Morgan Stanley's bond underwriting and M&A advisory units. ""The dealmaking pipeline that's been announced over the last quarter's earnings release is a great sign for all of the sectors. But in particular for banking, you have a lot of pent-up demand for deals, as we saw a dearth of transactions in 2023,"" PwC US banking & capital markets deals leader Dan Goerlich tells Yahoo Finance. ""And as we move into 2024, a lot of the banks are undertaking initiatives to look at growth across the spectrum, but in particular in organic growth through deals."" Goerlich expands upon his outlook for M&A activity and what it means for larger and regional banks, and how their priorities may differ: ""You have mega banks that are looking at a wide variety of different initiatives that might be product offerings, technology, new plays in fintech, and other businesses like asset and wealth and broker dealers. And then when you get into the regionals, it's a more traditional banking environment where growth might come from bolting on a more traditional merger where you have upscale in leverage and scale, but you also have new products and offerings that might come from that tie up.""

18/10/2024,00:00:00,JPM,How Big Banks are using AI and what it means for workers,"JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon says while artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to boost productivity, banks need to do more to help the workers who will be displaced by the tech. Synechron Co-Founder and CEO Faisal Husain joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss what the company that advises nine of the 10 of the largest banks outside of China on AI is telling clients. We believe that AI can play a big role in boosting productivity and thereby also reducing cost for a lot of financial institutions and also other enterprises. But at the same time, we're still in the very early stages of this technology. It will take time to get it to a point where, as Mr. Dimon says, it massively affects jobs. So I think it will be a gradual process. Husain says it will take time for banks to see the full return on their investment in AI. The technology is still evolving. It's evolving at a very fast pace. We're still trying to help our clients understand where it can be applied, how it can be applied, and people are going in different directions. Synechron is telling clients, Don't worry about finding the killer app for your company within your enterprise, Husain says, telling that ""productivity-focused initiatives"" should initially be aimed at saving minute amounts of time in workflows first. ""And use that as a way of leveraging AI within the enterprise rather than finding this nirvana, this killer app type of a solution which takes time.

The financial select sector SPDR fund (XLF) rose more than 6% in intraday trading on Wednesday, with names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Goldman Sachs (GS) gaining. KBW managing director David Konrad joins Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to discuss why Trump's win sent the sector higher and what bank investors are looking for from his second term. Konrad says, ""There's three main factors, all kind of surrounding deregulation to some extent,"" that sent bank stocks higher: less antitrust regulation leading to more mergers, lower capital constraints, and less pressure from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on consumer fees. ""The other factor would be a little bit of the concern of the inflationary ramifications of the Trump administration, potentially, and so people are looking for more asset-sensitive names for kind of a higher for longer, and those are really the true outperformers that we saw today.""

GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan joins Wealth! Host Brad Smith to outline why he is shifting away from tech and leaning into financials. ""We've been looking at growth as a source of funds for some months now. As it grew as a much larger component of major indices, we saw sentiment reached to extremes in a way that we just haven't seen in the past,"" Buchanan says, noting that ""A lot of that [growth] was largely the AI trade [and] kind of tech-oriented."" The portfolio manager says, ""We've been moving to a more balanced approach here over the last couple of months. Not necessarily selling or going short [on] tech in any possible way, [but rebalancing]."" Within the financials sector, he says, ""We absolutely have a preference towards some of the larger money center banks. We have positions in Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan (JPM), Citigroup (C), just to name a few,"" Buchanan says, explaining that the large financial institutions stand to benefit from macroeconomic conditions with loan growth and profitability expected to improve as ""economic activity and transactions continue to accelerate.""

Mulberry notes this makes it difficult to justify the S&P 500's current valuation levels. Looking ahead to 2025's expected pro-growth agenda under Trump, Mulberry cautions investors about market transitions. ""Simply what we're saying is we're at a moment of inflection as we change administrations and different policies come into play. You're really going to want to know what you own and know why you own it."" For investment strategy, Mulberry recommends focusing on sectors with ""real durable earnings structures"" like financials and utilities, which he believes offer better growth potential and stability compared to the broader market.

""We like to focus on quality and performance. So I think for the better performers in the group, you could see more expansion, frankly.

Whalen goes on to call commercial real estate one of the ""only pain point[s]"" for the industry, but warning: ""Banks that don't have a lot of consumer or commercial exposures are going to be fine. Banks that specialize in commercial real estate or have historically specialized in multifamily in some of the blue states, some of the larger cities are going to be taking pain.""
