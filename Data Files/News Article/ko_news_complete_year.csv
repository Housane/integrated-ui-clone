24/07/2024,00:00:00,KO,Best stock plays amid consumer weakness: Portfolio manager,"Shares of Coca-Cola (KO) are climbing higher after the company topped earnings estimates despite consumer weakness. With other consumer brands yet to report their earnings, Gradient Investments portfolio manager Keith Gangl joins Market Domination to discuss the state of consumer spending and some of his top stock picks amid the current economic backdrop. ""Coke had a good pricing and their mix was 9% up. That's very good. If you go back last year, all of Coke's EPS [earnings per share] growth was from pricing, right? Inflation went up. They passed on the price to consumers. Now, the good thing for the consumer side of things is they're not passing it all on price. They're also using volumes actually adding as well,"" Gangl explains. He notes that high-end consumers are doing well while lower-end consumers struggle. He is bullish on Amazon (AMZN) as a way to play both the consumer and tech sides of the market. Specifically on the consumer side, he points to Amazon's investments into capital expenditures (CapEx) that are starting to pay off as margins increase. He also points to McDonald's (MCD) as a company to watch as its value meals have the ability to draw consumers back in. As investors await the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut, Gangl believes that homebuilders and home improvement retailers like Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) will get a boost. Finally, he points to Costco (COST) as a ""consistent compound grower"" that has a solid grip on the middle and high-end consumer groups.

Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry joins Wealth! to break down the movement and how investors can best navigate the sell-off.

The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are slipping as recession fears trigger a widespread sell-off among investors. However, Fort Washington Investment Advisors co-chief investment officer Chris Shipley believes the current downturn shouldn't cause investor panic. He notes the market had ""a certain vulnerability"" due to expectations of economic growth and lower inflation. Yet, there turned out to be ""a little more economic weakness than the market was banking on,"" indicating the economy is entering ""a more substantial slowdown."" He views the current situation as an ideal buying opportunity, pointing to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which hasn't seen low share prices since March or April, noting: ""When stocks are on sale, it's time to start taking a look."" Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry argues that the market has been ""a little bit overdue for a pullback like this."" Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities. Some investors are concerned about the pullback's effects on their long-term retirement investments. Vanguard senior wealth advisor Cassandra Rupp, CFP, says, ""We can only control what we can control,"" and breaks down some of the biggest mistakes when managing 401(k) plans: ""Everyone's time horizon can be different. I mean, if we're speaking to some of this reporting in 401(k)'s for retirement savings, depends on what stage of your career you're at. We're seeing an increase in participant deferral rates above 4% now. So we're seeing more and more individuals start to automatically save out of their paychecks into these types of plans."" Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Kerry Hannon adds that if you're investing in a retirement account, you will experience periods where you're buying high and periods where you're buying low. In the end, it'll most likely even out. In response to recent signs of economic weakness, Wall Street is convinced the Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting. However, with investors believing the Fed may be delayed in rate reductions, speculation is growing about a potential cut even sooner. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jennifer Schonberger breaks down the details, discussing how the Fed can implement rate cuts outside of their scheduled meetings and historical trends that prompted emergency rate cuts.

20/09/2024,00:00:00,KO,Great investing debate: Growth or value stocks post-rate cuts?,"It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth  but says he's not a strict value investor. ""What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,"" he says, ""and in many cases, that can be growth stocks."" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. ""I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks."" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring ""good old fashioned names"" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. ""It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,"" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

24/10/2024,00:00:00,KO,Why Coca-Cola stock is among this Citi analyst's top picks,"Coca-Cola (KO) shares are under pressure after the companys earnings beat was overshadowed by declining volume as price increases take a toll on consumer demand. Citi US beverages and HPC lead analyst Filippo Falorni joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss Coca-Colas quarterly results and why he is bullish on the beverage companys stock. Generally the quarter was extremely solid in the context of a global macro environment which has been very volatile,ù Falorni tells Yahoo Finance, saying Coca-Cola is a true multinational company, over 70% of sales outside of the US. And their ability to really grow organic sales, which is the metric that we track more closely at a 9% rate, I think is a confidence of extreme solidity in their results both from a price mix standpoint and also volumes.ù The analyst says Volumes were down 1%. And that's what drove a little bit of the disappointment today in the quarter. Consensus was more expecting flattish volumes in this coming quarter.ù He notes that factors like negative weather in India, weakness in the Mexico region, and continued pressure in China and the Middle East contributed to the declining sales volumes. Companies have been taking a lot of pricing in the CPG [consumer packaged goods] space over the last two years. The difference for Coca-Cola is a lot of it is also mix-driven,ù the analyst says explaining that products like the Fairlife brand and higher-priced smaller cans have positively contributed to pricing. Falorni says pricing will likely normalize, though the stock remains among his top picks. Pricing has been very elevated over the last couple of years¶ Recently, they've been doing 10% plus on pricing. I think that's going to probably normalize more to the 3% to 4% range into next year.ù Coca-Cola remains our top name because when I think about the long-term organic sales growth profile of this business, I do have a high confidence that it can continue to deliver at the high end of the long-term algorithm¶ And the valuation, to me, is pretty attractive. It trades only at 23 times on 2025 numbers. Most of the comparable companies in my space, they trade at at least 25 to 26 times. So it's trading at a discount. The fundamentals are solid, and I think they're going to continue to be solid into 2025.ù To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.
