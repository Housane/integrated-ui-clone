With other consumer brands yet to report their earnings, Gradient Investments portfolio manager Keith Gangl joins Market Domination to discuss the state of consumer spending and some of his top stock picks amid the current economic backdrop. ""Coke had a good pricing and their mix was 9% up. That's very good. If you go back last year, all of Coke's EPS [earnings per share] growth was from pricing, right? Inflation went up. They passed on the price to consumers. Now, the good thing for the consumer side of things is they're not passing it all on price. They're also using volumes actually adding as well,"" Gangl explains. He notes that high-end consumers are doing well while lower-end consumers struggle. He is bullish on Amazon (AMZN) as a way to play both the consumer and tech sides of the market. Specifically on the consumer side, he points to Amazon's investments into capital expenditures (CapEx) that are starting to pay off as margins increase. He also points to McDonald's (MCD) as a company to watch as its value meals have the ability to draw consumers back in. As investors await the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut, Gangl believes that homebuilders and home improvement retailers like Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) will get a boost. Finally, he points to Costco (COST) as a ""consistent compound grower"" that has a solid grip on the middle and high-end consumer groups.

The company cut its full-year outlook, expecting sales to decline between 3 and 4%, but will things turn around? Zelman Associates Managing Director Adam Baumgarten joins Catalysts to give insight into Home Depot's latest quarterly results and what it signals for the broader housing market. Looking at Home Depot's numbers, Baumgarten states: ""I think you've been seeing a normalization in home improvement spending in general. So there was the huge surge as you know, in '20 and '21 and we've been giving back some of those gains. Part of that is the shift in share of wallet from goods to services. And I think even within goods you saw a surge in home improvement."" He follows that up with: ""We think that is back to somewhat normal as a percentage of overall consumer spending by the end of this year. So that's why we think next year you do return to growth for comps... But any kind of recession, which is not built into our forecast could push that out a bit more. Also, I think there was a bit more optimism earlier in the year as there was more of an outlook for rates coming down earlier in the year, and now that's been pushed out as we all know.""

""There are two common denominators right now that are jumping out. The first one being that as you mentioned, retailers are all about the omnichannel strategy. And this is what's important in order to attract the consumers to the stores. Home Depot (HD), Walmart, Lowe's (LOW) yesterday all told us, and even Target today they smashed their e-commerce estimate with a robust 8.3% growth in e-commerce. Consumers are are ordering things on their mobile phones and then wanting to pick them up in store on their way from work to home. And so this is really what's driving sales,"" says Martis Martis points out how consumers are really focused on value, ""they are shopping at the discounters, off-price retailers."" She adds ""The trend this year has been like you saw July retail sales... really smashing expectations. And that was because the average promotional rate and the amount of merchandise on sale really spiked to the highest level it did all year round.

07/09/2024,00:00:00,HD,Lower-income consumers are 'very stretched': Goldman Sachs,"""The words we actually heard were steady, choiceful, value-seeking, that's the consumer,"" Goldman Sachs managing director Kate McShane says about how the US consumer has been described by the retail sector. McShane sits down with Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma at the Goldman Sachs Global Retailing Conference to talk about the state of increasingly price-sensitive consumers as they head into the holiday shopping season and the 2024 presidential election in November. ""There is a lot of emphasis on value no matter what strata you are in terms of demographic,"" McShane states about what she is hearing from industry leaders, but she finds lower-income consumers to still be seeking out better prices. ""When you look at where prices were just a couple of years ago, there's a compounding effect to inflation and those lower-income consumers that don't have a lot of dollars to play with are still very stretched. So, I think they're looking more for price versus the value,"" McShane says. Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) have faced pressures recently, their respective stocks both diving on their latest earnings results and competition with big box stores. The way Dollar General explained it to us is that they do cater to a much lower-income consumer, $30,000 and below [is] 60% of their business. That consumer is still shopping with them, but they're very stretched. Their three weakest quarters in the I'm sorry months in the quarter were the last week of each month, which shows that the consumer doesn't have enough money to keep purchasing through the end of the month,"" McShane tells DiPalma. McShane goes on to address how home improvement retailers Lowe's (LOW) and Home Depot (HD) are responding to mortgage rates and the US consumer's biggest challenges expected for 2025.

20/09/2024,00:00:00,HD,Great investing debate: Growth or value stocks post-rate cuts?,"It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. ""What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,"" he says, ""and in many cases, that can be growth stocks."" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. ""I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks."" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring ""good old fashioned names"" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. ""It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,"" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

What it means for retailers,"Hurricane Milton is bearing down on Florida as the storm is forecasted to make landfall on the state's Gulf Coast Wednesday night. Initially raised to a Category 5 in days prior, Milton has been downgraded back to a Category 4 as it nears Florida. Tampa Electric CEO and President Archie Collins told Yahoo Finance its grid restoration effort will be the ""the biggest in in our history"" in the wake of Milton. In 2022, Hurricane Ian did ""$121 billion [in damages] and it only hit Fort Myers and swampland. [Milton] is hitting Tampa, Sarasota, Disney, Cape Canaveral, I mean this is hitting a lot of assets. So we're projecting at least $121 billion [in damages],"" Weather Trends International Founder and CEO Bill Kirk tells Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts. Weather Trends International is a private company that provides weather coverage and guidance to clients such as major retailers, manufacturers, and agricultural producers. Kirk comments on what Hurricane Milton and its subsequent damages could mean for home improvement retailers such as Lowe's (LOW), Home Depot (HD), and Tractor Supply Company (TSCO), and Weather Trends International's findings on this year's weather and climate patterns. ""Q4 we think is very strong. We have a very cooler, wetter, snowier La Niña-type winter, so we think it'll be stronger. Last year was the hottest in history right, so the sales were delayed until the polar vortex hit in January last year. This year you're moving all those sales up at full price full margin product,"" Kirk says on weather predictions. ""So we're very bullish on Q4 and then we have a train wreck in 2025.

We're looking for basically in-line results for the third quarter and [a] reiteration of the full-year guidance. That being said, I think the company can point to some green shoots that will positively impact its business into 2025, and those really revolve around what's happening with housing. Existing home sales on a pending basis are improving, especially in the Western region. In addition, we're seeing improvements in housing affordability despite the backup in interest rates. And we also have more homes available for sale,"" Basham says. The analyst tells Yahoo Finance, ""Generally speaking, we expect positive inclinations from the Trump administration as it relates to housing policy, which is good news for these guys. But as it relates to tariffs, that's the biggest headwind. 60% tariffs on products coming out of China would be a material negative for Home Depot.""
