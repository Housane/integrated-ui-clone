As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) snap their three-day losing streak, Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza joins the show to give insight into the market movement. He explains, ""The mega-cap companies, the 'Magnificent Seven,' have really been the star performers and folks who are looking for a rotation, whether it's to small caps or even other cyclical sectors like industrials and financials, haven't seen it yet. So it doesn't give people really a lot of confidence, even though to your point, for all intents and purposes, they should be particularly bullish. Look at money market assets, money in money market mutual funds are at all time highs. So it's sort of this weird environment where folks are seeking out safety."" The pharmaceutical industry is seeing significant movement. Shares of Moderna (MRNA) are falling after the company said its newly approved RSV vaccine was only about 50% effective after 18 months. Meanwhile, the US House Ways and Means Committee has proposed a strategy for Medicare to cover GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lily's (LLY) Zepbound. The amendment to the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act of 2023 will be voted on in Thursday's session. In the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace explains why Costco (COST) is a better investment than McDonald's (MCD) amid weak consumer spending. Versace sees Costco (COST) as a buying opportunity as the retail giant is ""extremely well positioned,"" with about 54% of its product revenue coming from fresh food and sundries. On the other hand, he is bearish on McDonald's, explaining that despite rolling out value meals, the fast food giant is ""no longer the cheap alternative."" As the 2024 presidential election inches closer, Blue Line Futures chief market strategist Phil Streible joins the show to highlight how each administration may affect the commodity market. He states, ""Energies are one of the top focuses that we're going to be watching. Under Trump, we were energy independent. We did also have a hard stance on Iran. It makes a play for lower energy prices if Trump was to come into office where we are much more dependent on OPEC, South American oil, it's very difficult for oil and gas exploration companies to get those permits to expand wells.""  This post was written by Melanie Riehl",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=db941cad5467b3d7df056709aec50517ac248b33f0d62f7401eddca471c700a2,1719439101

Goldman Sachs senior biotechnology analyst Chris Shibutani joins Market Domination to break down the health of the pharmaceutical large-caps and unrecognized areas of opportunity in the sector.  Shibutani says the industry is ""quite healthy,"" but acknowledges there are always ""cross currents."" He points to ""tremendous advancements"" in biotechnology innovation rising to daunting unmet needs, from cancer to cardiovascular disease. The analyst points to ""holy grail-like"" opportunities such as obesity drugs, and notes improvements in chemotherapy and next-generation antibody-drug conjugates for cancer treatment.

02/07/2024,00:00:00,LLY,Eli Lilly history: Beyond the Ticker,"With a rich history dating back to the 19th century, Eli Lilly (LLY) has faced struggles and successes. But a booming market cap has quickly turned it into the biggest pharmaceutical brand in the world. Let's dive into Lilly’s biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker. 1876 The company was founded by Colonel Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union Army veteran. Lilly served as the company president until he died in 1898. 1914-1918 Lilly experienced huge growth before and after World War I, including the expansion of its Indianapolis, Indiana, facility. 1923 The company began selling Iletin to treat diabetes, the world's first commercially available insulin product. 1952 Lilly became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. 1971 Lilly acquired cosmetic manufacturer Elizabeth Arden for $38 million, eventually turning it into a financial success. 1987 Lilly sold Arden to Fabergé for $657 million. 2009 A fine of over $1.4 billion, the largest in US history, was imposed on Lilly for illegally marketing its best-selling mood disorder product Zyprexa. 2022 Lilly hit the jackpot with tirzepatide, a new type of GLP-1 product, sold as Mounjaro for type II diabetes. It began competing with Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) Ozempic, which had been on the market for a few years, but started struggling to meet demand as its popularity grew for off label weight loss use. 2023 Zepbound, the same formula as Mounjaro, was approved for obesity, and it began competing with Novo’s Wegovy. The two companies have a duopoly in this brand-new obesity market. The tirzepatide drugs have spiked Lilly’s stock by nearly 100% in the past year, and its annual revenue was over $34.1 billion in 2023 – a nearly 20% increase year-over-year. 2024 Lilly continues to reach all-time highs and is currently the biggest healthcare company in the world, with a market cap of well over $800 billion. Wall Street projects the GLP-1s alone will net Lilly $13 billion this year. And this is all before the FDA expands their use for other diseases. Its why Lilly is on track to make history and be the first trillion dollar healthcare company. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

CrowdStrike management has addressed the outage as an incident related to an update, not a cyberattack.

ProShares global investment strategist Simeon Hyman joined the show to break down some of the best strategies investors should consider heading into the second half of 2024.

Its North America revenue declined 3% to $2.5 billion sequentially while international revenue rose 3% to $3.4 billion. Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) are soaring after the pharmaceutical giant received regulatory approval in China for its GLP-1 weight-loss drug, Zepbound. Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) recently posted its second quarter earnings, revealing total revenue of $2.08 billion, just below estimates of $2.12 billion. Net income available to common shareholders was $561 million, a 17% increase compared to the previous quarter. Fifth Third Bancorp CEO Tim Spence sits down with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the regional bank's performance as well as how it is preparing for uncertainty related to the Federal Reserve's interest rate environment and the 2024 election.

13/08/2024,00:00:00,LLY,Eli Lilly has 'a good story': Deutsche Bank analyst on upgrade,"Deutsche Bank is out with a bullish call on Eli Lilly (LLY), raising its rating on the pharma stock from Hold to Buy and lifting its price target by $300 to a total of $1,025 a share. Deutsche Bank Analyst James Shin joins Catalysts to break down the call and the pharmaceutical company's outlook. Shin says the biggest driver behind the call is Eli Lilly's improved visibility. He explains, ""they had outsized expectations and they beat them,"" pointing to GLP-1 weight-loss drug Mounjaro coming out of an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) shortage and meeting its benchmark goal of one and 1.5-times sellable doses. ""This is a great backdrop, right? Demand outstripping supply. You're selling everything you got. It's just a good story,"" he adds. Shin explains that despite improving its supply, Eli Lilly has shown that ""you can't walk into your pharmacy and get anything off the shelf right now."" As it focuses on meeting real-time demand, the pharmaceutical giant is focused on building new facilities and investing in its production capabilities. Morgan Stanley named Eli Lilly a top pick last week, citing it to have the ""strongest growth profile"" within its coverage universe.

28/08/2024,00:00:00,LLY,Why Eli Lilly is 'the Nvidia of GLP-1' weight-loss drugs,"Pharmaceutical companies have significantly grown over the last year as demand for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs continues to skyrocket. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza joins Market Domination for the latest installment of Good Buy or Goodbye to analyze his top pick in the GLP-1 market. Mazza is bullish on Eli Lilly (LLY) — maker of Wegovy and Zepbound — explaining that it has gotten a head start in the GLP-1 race as it has ""been working on these drugs for decades."" He adds that the company has an optimistic sales outlook, telling Yahoo Finance, ""We're seeing various drugs, Wegovy, grow at over 100%, 200% in some cases. And at the same time, the company is actually increasing their forecasts. So not just beating and raising, but blowing away the numbers."" Eli Lilly has recently announced that it will offer its obesity drug Zepbound on its direct-to-consumer website for a significant markdown. Mazza believes the initiative will get the drug in more patients' hands — especially those without insurance. ""I think what they're trying to do is basically make their total addressable market come to them quicker,"" he says of the move. On the other hand, Mazza is ""skeptical"" of Hims & Hers Health (HIMS). He notes that the stock has been ""slowly deteriorating"" after its initial buzz and highlights how its weight-loss offerings are compounding drugs rather than GLP-1 drugs. He explains that compounding drugs are ""made through compounding pharmacies, so a company goes up and makes treatments and therapeutics that look and feel a lot like the actual medicines."" These drugs are not FDA-approved, which Mazza believes is cause for some concern. He adds that Hims & Hers entered the market because of the sky-high demand that pharmaceutical giants like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk (NVO) couldn't meet. With both competitors now expanding, the supply chain will improve and he argues that more patients will turn to the name-brand GLP-1 drugs rather than the compounding drugs.

16/09/2024,00:00:00,LLY,This 'forgotten child' is one of the best biotech plays: Analyst,"Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee joins Market Domination to lay out his bull case on Gilead (GILD) and how investors should consider their biotech positions relative to the GLP-1 weight-loss craze. Yee notes that while Gilead's stock has not moved much over the last few years, it will likely take off as it moves forward with its new HIV prevention drug. ""They have announced this week a second positive Phase 3 study for a new HIV prevention drug... And with a twice-a-year injection — one jab every six months — you can prevent HIV and show people who are on PrEP, which is daily pills for the prevention of HIV, fully approved in America... high-risk individuals can now convert to a very simple, easy to administer drug with 100% prevention of HIV,"" he explains. He notes that this drug could generate a multi-billion total addressable market (TAM) and grow revenues by billions of dollars. ""So we're taking a very cheap stock, very down and out, very low expectations, no pipeline, and now they have a new layer to that,"" Yee adds. While GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have spurred the growth of the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors, Yee believes that ""we are in the fifth inning of a nine-inning game."" He says, ""Obviously, we had the early move maybe two and a half years ago on Novo (NVO)... And now we have cycle three, which is you have about 27 other companies that are in this game. So I think everybody kind of knows and has heard about GLP-1."" He adds that there are still good GLP-1 plays like Amgen (AMGN), as it moves forward in its trials for a monthly injection. He adds, ""We still believe that certainly Lilly (LLY) is in leadership position. We think there's room for others in a huge market. But you probably have to be more selective.""

20/09/2024,00:00:00,LLY,The best biotech plays outside the GLP-1 weight-loss market,"BMO Capital Markets managing director of biopharma equity research Evan Seigerman joins Market Domination to discuss the best biotech plays outside of the GLP-1 weight-loss space. The sky-high demand for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has led the biotech sector to reach new heights over the last year, and Seigerman believes the trend is as ""hot as ever."" He notes that the 2024 European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) meeting revealed key data highlighting the importance of these weight-loss drugs, and he believes that players like Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) continue to lead the industry's growth. However, he sees opportunities outside of the GLP-1 landscape, pointing specifically to Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex (VRTX) as prime examples. Vertex, a leader in cystic fibrosis research, makes up about $10 billion of its core franchise. The company is on track for early 2025 approval of its next-generation cystic fibrosis treatment as well as a non-opioid, non-addictive pain medication. In addition, Vertex has partnered with CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP) and received approval for Casgevy, a cell therapy treatment for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. Seigerman notes that the uptake has been slow as it requires patients to be in the hospital for at least a month as they go through the process. However, he explains that the therapy works and is ""really transformational"" for patients. While Seigerman is bullish on Vertex, he notes that the stock's price is rather high, trading in the upper $400s. The other risk he highlights is a non-opioid paid medication competitor coming to market.

The telehealth company swung to a profit, helped by a tax benefit and strong demand for GLP-1 weight-loss drugs. In an interview on Market Domination Overtime, Hims & Hers Health CFO Yemi Okupe speaks with anchors Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton about the quarter. ""We saw revenue up 77% year-over-year to north of 4$00 million. Simultaneously, we're also seeing very strong EBITDA margins at north of 13%,"" Okupe says. ""Additionally, at the end of the quarter, we also saw 2 million consumers on the platform, of which 1 million were benefiting from a personalized solution. And so really, the strong results that we're seeing in the third quarter are a reflection of us executing across the strategy that we've held for the past couple of years."" Okupe also addresses a possible headwind for the company, that Eli Lilly (LLY)'s and Novo Nordisk (NVO)'s weight-loss drugs are coming off the FDA's (Food and Drug Administration) shortage lists. But Okupe says it's not a concern right now, but acknowledges the shortages will come to an end.""In our view, we do still see that the medications are on on shortage. And what we do see on our platform. And this is the benefit of being a consumer oriented platform, is that we hear feedback directly from consumers and what consumers are telling us, you know resoundingly, is that they are struggling to get access to name-brand GLP-1 medications over the last two months,"" according to Okupe.
