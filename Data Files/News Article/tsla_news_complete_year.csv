Jewsikow calls the robotaxi plans as ""a massive pivot"" for Tesla, marking a shift from the company's previous focus on making electric vehicles more affordable. He notes that the robotaxi event announcement came on the heels of Tesla's decision to delay or cancel its ""next-generation platform,"" mounting more pressure on the robotaxi project to be a success. A full-scale launch ""prior to 2030 is unlikely,"" Jewsikow says about a realistic timeline for the robotaxi release date. Jewsikow views the period leading up to 2030 as a testing phase: ""post-2030 is when this is a meaningful contributor to the business, and I would say even probably well into the 2030s before this is even at scale.""

CEO Elon Musk, on the company conference call, said that more affordable EVs are on track for 2025 debut. Citi US autos & auto parts analyst Itay Michaeli joins Catalysts to give insight into Tesla's recent performance, how the company might turn it around, and how the auto sector may play out moving forward.

When asked if the robotaxi can be a saving grace for the company, Michaeli responds: ""I think it's all about the level of credibility in the actual deployment plan for Tesla. If the event is reminiscent of the 2019 Autonomy Day, that could receive some some pushback and disappointment. But if the company is able to actually leverage its advantages, which we think are really a low-cost robotaxi platform, the hardware costs, as well as, of course, their end-to-end AI capabilities, which are very strong into a credible deployment plan for robotaxi and other mobility services that could actually be perceived well.""

McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500  commonly referred to as the 493  being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

Tengler advises investors to purchase Tesla shares during ""periods of chaos."" She argues that Tesla investors are not solely focused on EV growth, but rather on ""the other elements of the business."" Tengler highlights segments such as utility-grade batteries, robotaxi technology, and full self-driving capabilities, stating: ""I think you're buying a company that's an AI company and less so a car company."" Addressing Elon Musk's support for Trump in the upcoming election, Tengler says, ""Elon is one CEO you don't want to underestimate.""

So I think there's synergies there that could be interesting."" He believes that the technology being developed at xAI could really benefit Tesla, and the EV company could invest even more to get more value down the road. On the Google front, Clinton says, ""we're sticking with it even though it's been volatile today."" While some investors were worried about the tech giant's capital expenditures (CapEx), Clinton explains that he's not concerned.

With new economic data, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE), signaling inflation may be under control, many expect the Federal Reserve to make its first interest rate cut in September. Catalyst Funds Co-Founder and CIO David Miller joins Catalysts to give insight into what recent economic data suggests for the Fed, the tech sector, and the broader markets moving forward.††† ""I think you're seeing some of this weak inflation data indicating inflation growth is actually slowing that that's giving the market more of an all-clear signal that the Fed is going to go ahead and finally do it and cut rates. So I think that's more of the response that we're seeing in equities today,"" says Miller Speaking on rotation out of tech and whether or not it should be considered a ""rout,"" he doesn't think it is, saying ""I think it's pretty unlikely that there's going to be a rout. The only real weakness we saw, for example, with Google was on the YouTube numbers that came in at 13%. But you know, we're still talking about double-digit growth. The real weakness, I guess, whether you call it auto or tech, was really more on Tesla, where you saw two sequential revenue declines, you know, totaling about 7% and real delays on whether their self-driving car service is really going to happen any time in the near future. So I think it's kind of a bit of a mixed bag, but I don't think we're in for a rout."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

26/07/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,"Market rotation, auto industry rebalancing: Asking for a Trend","On Thursday's edition of Asking for a Trend, Host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the biggest stories and themes impacting markets. The auto sector is grabbing investor attention as major companies like Stellantis (STLA) and Ford (F) report underwhelming second-quarter earnings. CarGurus director of industry insights and analytics Kevin Roberts explains that despite disappointing earnings, the auto industry is still ""quite healthy."" He notes that the earnings suggest the sector is going through ""a bit of a rebalancing right now."" The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) closed mixed on Thursday as they try to recover from a three-day tech sell-off. This downturn was triggered by disappointing earnings reports from Tesla (TSLA) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)  two of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants. Yahoo Finance reporter Jared Blikre analyzes the day's top market trends, discussing the rotation into small-cap stocks and Japan's financial markets, which appear to be going through a ""capitulation."" The future of regulation for startups and big businesses rests on the 2024 election, as former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have vastly different agendas. Tusk Venture Partners co-founder and managing partner Jordan Nof says that a new administration will likely bring a new leader to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ""and potentially a different posture that the FTC takes with antitrust specifically."" He notes that many investors are worried that Big Tech ""just does not want to transact right now,"" and that fear ""really takes a lot of the wind out of the sails in terms of how you can underwrite a deal to an exit."" He also explains that investors and early-stage fund managers prefer Trump-era policies compared to Biden's current policies and are most likely to vote with their pocketbooks in this election. Josh Lipton then breaks down what to watch on Friday, July 26th, before turning to some of the biggest movers in after-hours trading, from Skechers (SKX) to L3Harris Technologies (LHX).

Bernstein senior analyst Daniel Roeska joins Morning Brief to give insight into Tesla's recent performance as well as how it might fare with future earnings. ""They're trying desperately not to be a car company, quite honestly, the way they talked about Optimus and the other opportunities on the earnings call...I think, on the segment of cars, what you got to realize is there's going to be a model refresh in 2026 and the new model kind of Tesla 2, or whatever the name will be, likely is '27 and later. And that means any significant volume growth on the key aspect of cars at Tesla will likely have to wait quite a bit.

Dan Levy, Barclays senior autos analyst, joins Market Domination to discuss the current state of the auto industry. Levy identifies a trend in the auto industry: ""a pivot to demand constraints and away from supply constraints."" He explains that in recent years, demand was strong while supply was weak. However, ""that's really flipped this year,"" with automakers now ""grappling with this reality"" of softer demand. Regarding the potential impact of the upcoming election on the electric vehicle (EV) market, Levy notes that automakers will likely continue with their product planning cycles ""regardless of who is in office"". However, he points out that a Trump-Vance administration could potentially change the Inflation Reduction Act's EV tax purchase credit and might lead to softer regulatory mandates for the industry.

I think mortgage rates are likely already reflecting Fed expectations,"" Divounguy explains. ""And if the Fed delivers fewer rate cuts or none at all, we're likely going to see some upward pressure, not downward pressure on rates.""

08/10/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,3 sectors to watch ahead of the 2024 presidential election,"Recent market volatility has left many thinking about the potential impact of the 2024 US presidential election on stocks. EquitySet CEO Tony Zipparro joins Yahoo Finance to discuss three sectors to watch ahead of the election, including energy, technology, and consumer discretionary. ""If we're looking directly on themes and kind of motifs we can pull out of elections,"" Zipparro says, ""you look for the overlap, the Venn diagram of what is to avoid or consider in either candidates' case. And so when you look at policies¶ you look at domestic¶ and you look at innovation¶ you take those and you can kind of sprinkle it through any sector you want to look for good finds¶ or finds that may be positioned poorly based on what the policy comes to be."" He thinks it makes more sense to pick individual stocks instead of a basket of stocks. In energy, Zipparro's top picks are Chevron (CVX), NextEra Energy (NEE), Dominion Energy (D), and Tesla (TSLA), while some names to avoid are Peabody Energy (BTU) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK). In tech, some names Zipparro says to consider are Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). ""It's really... looking at domestic. Most semis have a large exposure to international supply chain production, manufacturing, something. And so that's where I think you look at innovation because the domestic picture isn't as clear,"" Zipparro notes. In consumer discretionary, Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Columbia Sportswear (COLM), and Yeti (YETI) are among Zipparro's top picks. ""I think it's buying into those that are domestic... or manufacture and produce more in the US,"" Zipparro says.

08/12/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,Non-Mag 7 equities are a 'once in a generation opportunity',"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks are aiming to recoup losses in Monday's trading session after last week's global sell-off which significantly impacted the sector. As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

09/06/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,"Services PMI, labor data portray mixed economic picture: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Brad Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the biggest stories of the trading day, from fresh economic data to the tumultuous week for the auto industry. The services sector expanded in August, according to the latest ISM Services PMI data. The reading was 51.5, just slightly higher than Wall Street's expectation and July's reading of 51.4. Meanwhile, 99,000 private payroll jobs were added to the US labor market in August, according to ADP. This figure came in well below original forecasts of 145,000 jobs. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods emphasizes the importance of economic data leading into the Federal Reserve's September policy meeting in two weeks. As the US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release August jobs data on Friday, Woods calls the print ""the biggest unemployment report we've had since the last one, obviously, which came two days after the Fed meeting."" It's been a rocky week for the auto industry as General Motors (GM) was downgraded by Wolfe Research, Volkswagen (VOW3.DE, VWAGY, VOW.DE, VWAPY) is considering shuttering some of its plants, and Tesla (TSLA) announced plans to release its Full Self-Driving technology in China and Europe in the first quarter of 2025. Autoblog editor-in-chief Greg Migliore explains that amid the wave of negative news for the industry, Tesla was rewarded for not making any drastic moves. Tuesday marked one of the biggest sales of high-grade corporate bonds, amounting to $43.3 billion. S&P Global Ratings global head of private markets analytics Ruth Yang joins the Catalysts team in-studio to discuss the credit market outlook as the Federal Reserve begins its rate easing cycle. ""We're looking for the rates to drop by about 150 basis points over the next 15 months. So the world is kind of starting to say, 'OK, we've got inflation under control. Things are getting better. Credit is settled in higher for longer. And now is the opportunity to kind of refinance and get the wheels really back in motion,'"" Yang tells Yahoo Finance.

It's a buy the news, sell the news reaction to the Fed,ù Chronert says. The leadership this quarter has really been those areas of the market that are perceived beneficiaries of lower rates. So real estate, utilities, even the homebuilder ETFs have been hitting recent highs. In the meantime, tech is still lagging where it was last time the index was through 5,600."" Essentially what you have here¶ is that a bit of a profit taking on the news in those areas that have been perceived as rate sensitive. And, at the same time, a catch-up move in that mega-cap growth cohort that ultimately does benefit from lower interest rates, but has been a relative laggard thus far this quarter. All told, what you've got is an index moving higher.ù Taking a look at the Magnificent 7, Chronert outlines Citis view on the group: We've been arguing for the better part of this year that they're becoming more idiosyncratic in their behavior.ù He explains that Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT)  who control over 6% of the index  ""those companies are going to be important to index price action and I think you're seeing that today.

Munoz points to Tesla (TSLA) as a good buy, explaining that the company's autonomous driving initiatives will be key to its next phase of growth. While other companies, like Waymo, are rolling out their own robotaxis, Munoz believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition as it has much more data to train its vehicles. However, he points to potential regulatory and policy risks down the line. He also highlights its improving financials, believing the company has ""a lot of cash to deliver on their product roadmap."" He expects third quarter deliveries to come in between 460,000 and 470,000. Munoz notes that Tesla is ""not just a car company."" He is bullish on its energy businesses, highlighting the ""explosive"" second quarter revenue growth. ""That's something that gets us excited away from just the selling of vehicles. And the auto industry has had some struggles over the last couple of years in this macro environment, but also with higher rates. So their diversified business lines and revenue there gets us very excited,"" he explains. Meanwhile, Munoz is bearish on Rivian (RIVN), telling Yahoo Finance, ""They need a lot of cash. This is a scale industry, and very recently, this summer, they partnered with Volkswagen (VWAGY). They got $5 billion to roll out the next phase of their growth, which is lower-cost vehicles. And so this is something that we're looking at. It's an unprofitable business. They lose money for every car that they make, and we're in an environment where consumers have preferences and there are options."" In addition, Rivian is facing production challenges. Last month, the company paused the production of its electric delivery vehicles for Amazon (AMZN) one of its biggest customers. Munoz also notes that production declined last quarter, and while it appears as if the company will meet its targets, it's enough to make him feel ""uncomfortable."" Finally, he argues that Rivian's offerings are not only narrow but too expensive relative to other EV players. Coupled with production challenges, he adds, ""They have to get these vehicles out to market to get sales to drive revenue, to hopefully become a profitable company. And they expect to do that by 2026. We don't know if they're going to make it."" Munoz concludes, ""If they can lower their cost, if they can leverage their partnership with Volkswagen, and they can crank production up and get cars on the streets, I think that would be really positive for Rivian over the long run.""

As Tesla has shifted focus from creating a lower-cost vehicle to emphasizing autonomous driving and other ventures, investors are questioning whether this is the best strategy for the automaker. Munoz comments, ""In the macro environment we're in, we saw consumer confidence come in a little bit lower this morning, and interest rates are still high. So affordability is a big question analysts are mulling over. When we look at vehicles, it's a major purchase for consumers. Whether it's their house or their vehicle, it's one of their highest costs. I think it would be smart for Tesla to roll out a lower entry-level vehicle at a lower price point.""

While optimistic about the technology's potential, Gerber believes ""we're just not there yet."" ""I still am curious about...how they'll deploy enough cars at the right times in the right places to fulfill demand efficiently,"" Gerber tells Yahoo Finance, adding, ""I'm not sure how this all works."" ""Why I own Tesla is they make the best EVs in the world... If they focus on selling EVs that are super safe with great technology, they can be wildly successful. Pivoting into becoming a robot company is an extremely high-risk move that is non-quantifiable, and there's no market for it yet,"" he explains.

This has sent other rideshare stocks like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) higher on Friday. Roth MKM managing director Rohit Kulkarni joins Catalysts to discuss the rideshare sector. Kulkarni notes that the anticipation for Tesla's event was ""an overhang"" on Uber and Lyft stocks. He explains that the main investor question has been: If Tesla emerges as the preferred rideshare option, what happens to Uber and Lyft? This concern has grown ""louder and louder over the last 3-6 months."" However, based on the outcome of Thursday's robotaxi event, Kulkarni says it was ""a big, big relief"" for these companies because the event demonstrated that ""creating a scalable robotaxi business is not easy."" He notes it will take extensive time and resources, while Uber and Lyft continue to gain market share. ""Tesla as a big, big player or potential big player is now off the table. That's the relief rally that you're seeing in Uber and Lyft,"" he states, adding that the next significant catalyst for these companies would likely come from advertising and subscription growth.

Here's why.,"On today's installment of Good Buy or Goodbye, host Julie Hyman is joined by BD8 Capital Partners, LLC, CEO and CIO Barbara Doran to discuss her investment outlook in the rideshare space.  Doran recommends Uber (UBER) as a stock to buy, emphasizing its dominant market position and diversified business model. She notes, ""they are just growing their share,"" currently at 76%, with its closest competitor, Lyft (LYFT), at just 23% of the rideshare market. Furthermore, Doran points out that Tesla's (TSLA) Cybercab unveil at its Robotaxi Day event suggests competition for autonomous driving isn't an imminent threat, as it will be ""hard for them to catch up."" She also highlights Uber's strong financial position, citing profitability, free cash flow of $1.7 billion, and a $7 billion share buyback authorization. The primary risk she identifies is a potential slowdown in consumer spending. On the other hand, Doran advises avoiding Lyft stock. She notes the company's lower profitability and significantly smaller scale compared to Uber, stating it's ""going to be very tough"" for Lyft to achieve Uber's current market status. Additionally, she points out Lyft's high debt-to-equity ratio, resulting in a weak balance sheet. Lyft stock also consistently underperforms its main competitor, Uber.

10/12/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,"Tesla stock sank, Uber rose after robotaxi event. Here's why.","Uber (UBER) shares ticked higher on Friday after Tesla's (TSLA) robotaxi event left investors largely disappointed. GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager Thomas Martin joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the competition between the two and why Uber benefitted from the event. ""Both Tesla stock and Uber reacted the way you would have expected given the robo-day from Tesla. It was a classic example of long-term versus short-term. And they were the opposite for Uber and for Tesla,"" Martin says of the movement. He tells Yahoo Finance that ""if Tesla was able to solve automated vehicles and robo in the near term or you saw a roadmap for even the intermediate term, then that was a problem potentially for Uber longer term. But the devil is in the details."" As investors were left looking for more insight and further information about the robotaxi rollout, Uber became more attractive to investors. If Tesla cannot meet expected timelines for the release of its robotaxis, Uber will, therefore, have more time to get ahead of the game.

10/12/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,Tesla is a 'high-growth stock' that has 'hit a wall': Analyst,"Tesla's (TSLA) long-awaited robotaxi event largely disappointed investors who were left wanting more details. CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson joins Morning Brief to discuss how the event is weighing on Tesla's stock and whether CEO Elon Musk can deliver value to shareholders. Nelson believes that the decline in Tesla's stock could be the beginning of a larger pullback. ""If you look at where it's trading on consensus estimates, the stock where it closed yesterday is trading at 75 times consensus estimates for next year. Looking out to 2026, it's trading at 57 times. So these are really pretty lofty multiples. And here we're left with a lot of questions regarding how it's going to achieve that earnings growth that is embedded in expectations over the next few years,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. He adds, ""This is a high-growth stock whose growth has hit a wall here recently."" Nelson points out that Elon Musk has a history of not meeting previously communicated timelines: ""If you look back a decade ago, he was promising fully autonomous vehicles only a year or two away. Here we are in 2024, and it's still that. We think Tesla is still a ways away from that."" Thus, he believes that the investors' expectations are ""too high,"" especially given a general slowing of EV sales. With such a lack of clarity around Tesla's product pipeline, Nelson argues that auto names like General Motors (GM) and Uber (UBER) are among the best positioned to win when Tesla loses.

10/12/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,Tesla's robotaxis show why the EV trade is 'tricky': Analyst,"Tesla (TSLA) finally unveiled its autonomous vehicles at its highly anticipated robotaxi event Thursday evening. Katy Kaminski, AlphaSimplex chief research strategist and portfolio manager, joins Wealth! to discuss how investors can best navigate the EV trade. ""I think the EV trade is a tricky one. It's exciting because anytime you have a disrupter of that type that is going to go in and potentially disrupt a business model that exists already, there's a lot of uncertainty about that type of event,"" Kaminski tells Yahoo Finance. She notes that there was a sell-off in Tesla's stock after the event, while names like Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) were up. She explains, ""What I would think that means is that this is an exciting idea. We need to watch it. But we also have a lot of things have to be figured out for this to come to fruition. So I think it's really a trade you'll have to watch and actually see ... how can they navigate the regulation front, how can they handle some of those issues that disrupting this industry would require."" While the EV market has been under pressure, Kaminski highlights that inflation has been weighing on consumers, and many have put their plans to purchase cars on hold. She argues that Tesla's robotaxis could benefit from this environment, saying, ""If vehicles continue to be more expensive, people are going to have to find alternatives. And that's where this could be a good trade."" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.

Investors are watching closely to see if the earnings report can provide a positive catalyst for the stock, following the muted market response to both the company's third quarter delivery figures and recent robotaxi event. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods joins to share his outlook on the electric vehicle maker's prospects ahead of the results. Woods acknowledges one positive technical indicator for Tesla: the stock has broken from its long-term downtrend that began at its November 2021 high. However, he notes that in 2024, Tesla remains the worst-performing stock among major tech names, leading him to state, ""I don't even consider it one of the Mag 7."" ""It has been trading on hopes and dreams, and now investors want a show-me stock,"" Woods explains, suggesting that companies like Netflix (NFLX) or Eli Lilly (LLY) would be better suited for the Magnificent Seven. Regarding today's upcoming earnings report, Woods characterizes the potential market reaction as a ""coin flip."" ""It's one to watch.

Everything is on track on the more affordable cars."" Narayan discusses Tesla's earnings print and what it is forecasting about the electric automaker's margins: ""They did do some discounting and they're going to try to get that growth number for the full year. So Q4 you're going to see some price-cutting. But if they can still do a 17% margin, X credits, that's a pretty strong signal that... they can continue to hold on to margins."" Tesla reported 462,890 EV deliveries, just below Wall Street consensus estimates 463,897. Narayan believes Tesla's Full Self-Driving upgrades and pivots to autonomous driving could be boosting its demand. ""The services number was pretty high. So I do wonder if the services attach rate, especially FSD, might be making making an impact here. Folks could be thinking I'm going to buy this car because of FSD,"" Narayan says. ""That may be catalyzing demand. And kind of even though the models are maybe a little long in the tooth... FSD is something, something special here that might be what's happening.""

11/06/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,Will Elon Musk's 'big bet' on Trump pay off for him and Tesla?,"Billionaire Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has been vocal in his support for former President Donald Trump's election campaign. Intelligent Alpha CEO and founder and Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Doug Clinton sits down with Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime to discuss what the election outcome means for Musk and how his political involvement affects investors. ""It will be a very interesting night for Elon Musk,"" Clinton says, adding, ""He's obviously made a really big bet on the election going one direction. And I think if it goes against him if Kamala Harris is elected president, I think it probably is a negative for him."" He notes that Tesla could stand to benefit from a Harris presidency, given she could provide further tax incentives for electric vehicles as part of a green energy push. Clinton says that Musk will likely ""find some way to try to mend fences and say, 'Look, obviously, it didn't go the way that we were campaigning, but we have this agenda that actually does very much align with some of the principles of the Democratic Party.' I mean, Elon probably has done more for bringing sustainable energy into the markets, kind of into the mass markets, really in the US and globally than maybe anybody else in the world."" As an investor in Musk's companies, Clinton says, ""We try to separate [Musk's companies from his politics]. At Deepwater, we are investors in xAI, and we're big believers that there's basically four companies on Earth that have a chance to build the foundation models that power sort of everything. It's Meta (META) with Llama, it's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) [with] Gemini, OpenAI with GPT, and then xAI with Grok. So that investment is really built, I think, more on just what can they do from a technical perspective.""

But we also know that Donald Trump doesn't necessarily support that thinking,"" iSeeCars.com Executive Analyst Karl Brauer told Yahoo Finance. Brauer notes that a ""government-led transition to EVs"" is not a concept that Trump has embraced. He points to the broader EV market beyond Tesla, noting that other stocks in the sector are not experiencing the same rally as Tesla. ""It's interesting to see that people feel like Elon's relationship with Donald Trump will overcome a potential shift in policy,"" he adds.

11/08/2024,00:00:00,TSLA,Trump prepares Cabinet picks amid uncertain House control,"With former President Donald Trump's election victory, he will now begin the process of transitioning back into the White House and selecting members for his Cabinet. This comes as politicians and observers await the final determination of whether the Democrats or Republicans will gain control of the House of Representatives. Bipartisan Policy Center executive director of economic policy Shai Akabas and The Washington Note founding editor-at-large Steve Clemons provide insights into the potential makeup of Trump's incoming administration on Wealth! Clemons notes that multiple individuals are being considered for key Cabinet positions, including names like Mike Pompeo, Lindsey Graham, Tom Cotton, and Josh Hawley. However, Clemons does not foresee Elon Musk being appointed to a formal Cabinet role despite being a major influence throughout Trump's campaign period. ""I think Elon is in a complicated position. For him to get a Senate-confirmed position, I think he'd have to pretty much divest himself from a lot of his assets that define him, like SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA)."" Instead, Clemons believes Musk may be offered an advisory role. One of the initiatives Musk has reportedly advocated for is cutting federal spending by up to $2 trillion. Akabas calls this an ""admirable goal,"" but notes the challenge lies in the fact that much of the government's spending is on ""autopilot"" through programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and interest on the national debt. Akabas explains that the potential areas for cuts represent only around 15% of the overall federal budget. ""Even if you eliminated that entire part of the federal spending, which encompasses most government agencies, you would not solve our fiscal challenges that we have today,"" he states.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk's involvement in his political campaign has sparked speculation about a potential advisory role in Trump's administration. Wedbush managing director and senior equity research analyst Dan Ives joins Asking for a Trend to discuss potential impacts on Tesla and the broader tech sector. ""It's a new era with Trump because ultimately, if you look now, autonomous is going to get fast-tracked in our opinion, and that is significant because of Tesla and the AI future,"" he tells Yahoo Finance, describing Musk's strategic backing of Trump a ""poker move for the ages."" Ives outlines three key potential impacts that could benefit: changes to EV tax credits could give Tesla advantages in price, scale, and scope, the Cybercab project ""could get accelerated by years,"" and current regulatory issues ""essentially now go away."" ""Musk is going to be a whisper in the White House, and that is something the market is factoring in,"" Ives states, describing it as ""a Goldilocks scenario for any tech investor.""

To expand more upon how Corporate America is interpreting Trump's 2024 election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, ARK Investment Management CEO and CIO Cathie Wood sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination Overtime. Wood's firm manages the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which has a variety of holdings in tech players like Tesla (TSLA), Palantir Technologies (PLTR), and Coinbase Global (COIN). Wood calls Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler ""a menace"" to crypto-adoption in the US, and says replacing FTC Chair Lina Khan will ""break the M&A logjam"" for most companies. ""I think venture capital has been harmed dramatically in the last few years, for lack of liquidity events. Liquidity events, very importantly, involve mergers and acquisitions, and those ground to a halt, even in mergers or deals where the two companies were not competing with each other,"" Wood tells Yahoo Finance. A long-time supporter of Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Wood believes he will play a ""vitally important role"" in Trump's government efficiency initiative while remaining ""focused"" on the plethora of companies he owns. ""As he says, and I've always believed, government spending is taxation, and we are bloated right now. We're just overwhelmed with taxation as well,"" Wood explains. ""So I think that he's going to be really important in two ways  introducing new technologies, and actually cutting out a lot of middlemen in the government, just like he did at Twitter."" Tesla currently makes up 14.21% of the ARK Innovation ETF, the holdings worth just over $900 million. Wood is forecasting Tesla stock to reach $2,600 in five years time; while confident in the EV maker's ability to bring safe fully autonomous vehicles to market, she disagrees that Tesla's most recent stock jump has to do with Musk's affiliation with Trump.

Will his relationship with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk help influence his decision over these tax credits? Will the two clash over their environmental ideologies? We get into it. In this weeks episode of Capitol Gains, anchor Rachelle Akuffo, Washington Correspondent Ben Werschkul, and senior columnist Rick Newman break down everything you need to know about the history of these EV credits and whether or not they could still have a future under the Trump administration. Werschkul says its ""a real interesting question"" and the Trump/Musk relationship could factor into the future of these credits. I think there is a real case to be made that Tesla (TSLA) is fine with a fossil fuel-focused agenda including a rollback of some of the green energy credits,ù Werschkul says. Tesla is an established EV company. If the startups around him get their government funding cut off theyre in a lot of trouble. Tesla is fine. Teslas a company. Teslas not going anywhere.ù Newman breaks down the history of the EV tax credits and how they started during the Obama administration. Theres a large degree of irony here,ù Newman says. Those consumer credits really persuaded a lot of early adopters to buy a Tesla. And I think theres a lot of people early on who bought a Tesla who would not have bought it, if not for the tax credit. So that helped Tesla become the leading electric vehicle company, and now [Tesla doesnt] need it.ù To learn more, listen to the full episode of Capitol Gains here.

Kohrs is positive on bitcoin, citing its performance against the U.S. dollar. ""Now, in the short term, your guess is as good as mine. We might as well just be flipping a coin. But in the long term, if this idea of a store of value and the US dollar always being devalued, I think bitcoin goes higher and higher.""

He's less positive when analyzing the fundamentals of GameStop (GME) and other so-called ""meme stocks.""

Strategy Risks Founder and CEO Isaac Stone Fish joins Catalysts to analyze the implications for major companies, including Nike (NKE) and Tesla (TSLA). According to Fish, Nike's primary challenge centers on its regional sales performance. While the company maintains a ""relatively high"" supply chain presence, it faces mounting pressure from local competitors ""that are trying to displace Nike"" as Chinese officials aim to reduce foreign brands' dominance in its market. Fish emphasizes that ""retailers and manufacturers need to make a decision about how much they're going to focus on China,"" citing weakening consumer demand and ongoing US-China tensions as key factors. Regarding Tesla's position in China, Fish observes that ""Tesla's future in China is so tied to Trump's relationship with Musk"" and how long that lasts. He highlights additional concerns about Tesla's data collection capabilities in China, noting that ""there's a lot of concern that Teslas can drive into [or near] a military installation... and they're [China] a lot more paranoid about that than the Europeans or the Americans are on data protection.""

William Blair Group head of energy and sustainability research Jed Dorsheimer joins Market Domination to analyze the company's figures. Dorsheimer observes ""investor fatigue"" surrounding Tesla's latest offerings, including the Cybertruck and Models S and X. He notes that, while the Cybertruck's price is set to decrease, it remains ""a very niche market"" for that vehicle type, suggesting a limited impact on overall deliveries. He emphasizes that Tesla's success primarily stems from its more affordable offerings: the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. ""For Tesla to rebound from a volume perspective on the auto side of its business, we think it's really going to be the introduction of a Model 2 or hatchback,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.† Dorsheimer highlights ""a silver lining"" in Tesla's energy storage side and concludes, ""Tesla has a lot of different tools in its toolbox, and we'll see how it plays out.

01/07/2025,00:00:00,TSLA,Tesla's stock valuation appears 'discounted': Analyst explains,"President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariff policy has raised investor concerns about its potential impact on industries, including electric vehicles (EVs), particularly for companies like Tesla (TSLA). Stifel NextGen transport analyst Stephen Gengaro joins Market Domination to share his perspective on the EV maker amid tariff uncertainties. Gengaro suggests that Trump's proposed tariff policy would have ""wide-ranging"" effects, including reduced competition in US markets  a development that could be ""theoretically a positive"" for Tesla. However, he cautions that the company may face challenges with its international supply chain for parts sourced outside the US. The analyst emphasizes that Tesla is ""more than a car company,"" pointing to initiatives like full self-driving (FSD) technology as ""a huge value driver"" for the stock in the ""medium-to-long term."" He suggests that the potential of these ventures makes the current stock valuation appear ""discounted."" Looking ahead to the Trump administration, Gengaro anticipates more favorable regulations that could accelerate Tesla's initiatives. ""As far as Musk betting on Trump, I think he's clearly engaged in the conversation as far as getting regulation accelerated on the FSD side,"" he explains. ""And that sort of opens the door for just various growth opportunities for the company over time.""

This may be bolstered by the fact that reduced EV spending overall is anticipated under Trump 2.0, positioning Tesla to be the winner of the sector.

He references Nvidia's early involvement in autonomous vehicles, stating, ""frankly they were a little too early,"" but suggests their head start with such technology means ""now they're coming in much more strongly."" Highlighting Nvidia's ""Cosmos"" release, an artificial intelligence (AI) software platform that ""allows you to do gen AI for physical actions."" In other words, users can train robots, autonomous vehicles, and other devices ""to react and do analog things in the physical world."" He emphasizes its significance, adding, ""That's been a huge stopping point for robotics, and that's why it's a big deal and will have a payoff."" Drawing a parallel to other tech giants, O'Donnell tells Yahoo Finance, ""We think about Microsoft (MSFT) on the Windows side, and we think about Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) on the mobile phone side, and maybe Nvidia becomes sort of the platform for robotics.""

The EV makers stock has been run over since President Trumps Jan. 20 inauguration day, plunging 43%. Its not hard to find reasons for the tanking. The publics rebuke of DOGE master and Trump supporter Elon Musk has translated into falling sales.

The turnaround vision must start this Tuesday night on the earnings conference call for Musk and Tesla,ù tech analyst Dan Ives says. Here are three things that Musk must do on the earnings call to begin rebuilding investors' sentiment in the stock:  Government exit timeline: Musk must tell investors when he plans to exit his DOGE role and get back to 100% focus on Tesla. Tariff impact: Musk (or other execs on the earnings call) must clearly quantify the financial impact of Trumps tariffs on Teslas business. Turning Tesla around: Musk must articulate the turnaround plan for Tesla. Whether he likes it not, Tesla is now a turnaround story in the eyes of investors.
