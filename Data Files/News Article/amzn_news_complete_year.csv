Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza joins Market Domination to give insight into how markets are moving this week and what investors can expect moving forward. ""The mega-cap companies, the 'Magnificent Seven,' have really been the star performers and folks who are looking for a rotation, whether it's to small caps or even other cyclical sectors like industrials and financials, haven't seen it yet. So it doesn't give people really a lot of confidence, even though to your point, for all intents and purposes, they should be particularly bullish. Look at money market assets, money in money market mutual funds are at all time highs. So it's sort of this weird environment where folks are seeking out safety,"" Mazza tells Yahoo Finance.

The data is set to be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET, and he notes that the last month of data has been higher. He explains that another hotter-than-expected print could be cause for concern: ""As people get laid off, they're going to go and file for unemployment benefits at some point, most likely. So you start to get a little bit more sense of what's actually happening. This is one of the key indicators when people talk about recession risk, if jobless claims tick up.

As inflation has put consumers under pressure, Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva provides insight into Americans' dining preferences. A recent Lightspeed survey found that 51% of respondents plan to dine out at the same rate or more frequently in the next six months. He argues that Americans love dining out, pointing to the 81% who dine out at least once a month and 39% who eat out at least once a week. Meanwhile, the results of the Federal Reserve's latest bank stress test results show all 31 of the nation's largest banks could continue to lend in the event of a severe recession. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger breaks down the results and what it means for investors. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer joins the show to break down his biggest takeaways from the trading day, from Amazon's (AMZN) $2 trillion market capitalization to the upcoming weekly jobless claims data. As part of Yahoo Finance's Space Race: Investing in the Final Frontier series, Varda Space Industries Co-Founders Will Bruey and Delian Asparouhouv sit down with Akiko Fujita to give insight into the advantages of pharmaceutical research in microgravity. Bruey outlines how microgravity works and how the company is utilizing it here on Earth, explaining, ""It's ubiquitous and it's impossible to create in perpetuity on Earth. And so we essentially are building space manufacturing modules because we can change the outcome of chemical systems like no one else can on Earth."" Finally, S&P 500 (^GSPC) performance and breadth have hit one of the biggest dislocations in 30 years. Fundstrat Global Advisors managing director Mark Newton tells Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman, ""It doesn't have to mean that the market is going to go into a correction or roll over. Those tech stocks can continue to go up and that divergence can get wider and wider, similar to what we saw back in 2021. However, we can also see what I think is going to happen is as a start of the broader market to play catch up. And we've seen a little bit of that in financials over the last week.""

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500  commonly referred to as the 493  being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

26/07/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,"Ulta faces challenges from Amazon, consumer loyalty","Piper Sandler has downgraded Ulta Beauty (ULTA) from Overweight to Neutral. Piper Sandler senior research analyst Korinne Wolfmeyer joins Market Domination to discuss her reasoning behind the call and how it is faring against other big names in the beauty industry. Wolfmeyer points to Ulta's promotions as a ""reaction to the competitive intensity we've seen over the past several months and even years, both from brick-and-mortar retail peers such as Sephora that's really ramped up its store count with its partnership with Kohl's (KSS), but also with online players like Amazon (AMZN) that's really ramped up its prestige beauty offering and seen a lot more brands feel comfortable selling on digital platforms like Amazon."" She notes that this competition has placed Ulta under pressure, and that ""there's a lot less confidence in the margin opportunity going forward."" She adds that Amazon is a ""threat to everybody,"" as it has a wide offering of products. Wolfmeyer explains that Ulta has a mass offering larger than Sephora, so it may be losing some share to Amazon. While Ulta's target demographic is broad-based, she argues that overall, customers are ""diversifying where they're shopping, and they want to shop at all the different retailers. They don't want to stay loyal to just one."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

08/12/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Non-Mag 7 equities are a 'once in a generation opportunity',"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks are aiming to recoup losses in Monday's trading session after last week's global sell-off which significantly impacted the sector. As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states.

Built like humans and fueled by artificial intelligence, the machines are learning to tackle complicated tasks at a rapid rate. The advancement of generative AI is supercharging how quickly humanoids can learn, backed by vast amounts of data and high-powered chips. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) has doubled down on its future, building out an ecosystem that enables robotics makers to customize their products. The Isaac robotics platform, which includes generative AI foundation models and tools, allow developers to simulate real- world movements in the digital world, while Nvidias Thor system-on-a-chip (SOC) provides the computing power needed to drive the transformation. Already, Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and others are incorporating humanoids in their work spaces. At a recent shareholder meeting, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the machines had the potential to propel the EV maker into a $25 trillion market cap company. Tesla is looking to capture the market by integrating its Optimus humanoid into factory floors. Musk has said two robots have already been deployed at the companys Fremont, California factory and predicted a few thousand Optimus robots to be working by 2025. But the company faces plenty of competition. Austin-based Apptronik has already signed partnerships with logistics firm GXO and Mercedes-Benz to deploy its humanoids to their floors, while Amazon has begun using Agilitys Digit robot in its test facility.

Thill breaks down the situation with the tech giants' AI efforts: ""Microsoft told you a year ago that it would be the fastest business to $10 billion. They haven't said a peep about hitting that target. Microsoft is going to be a $250 billion dollar-plus company. That means it's a low single digit percent of their total revenue. Amazon (AMZN), they don't even break out the number. Google (GOOG, GOOGL), how is the AI product going? Well, there's no financial impact right now. Like, so Salesforce (CRM), they're not selling AI. Adobe (ADBE) it's tiny... it's tiny for everyone. "" He brings it back to Snowflake's (SNOW) current situation: ""It's not like this is Snowflake losing and everyone else is winning. No one's winning in software in AI because it's so early. There's no revenue, but there will be. And so the point is, do you want to invest?""

Mintz Levin Sports Entertainment Practice Chair Steven Olenick joins Market Domination Overtime to break down the news. ""A lot of these athletes bring out their personality, build businesses around them to cultivate media properties, content. What does everyone want right now? They want great content. Why? Because it could potentially bring in viewers. And what do you think you can do off that? You can sell things within that content,"" Olenick says of the Kelce brothers' latest business move. ""So I think what they're doing here is doing almost like a test case right here to try to build it out."" As for whether private equity firms can buy into teams, Olenick believes the vote will pass, explaining: ""I think it's a done deal. I think you have people waiting right now. And I think you have owners ready to take that money."" He notes that if the vote passes, owners will be able to take liquidity and reinvest in succession planning so they do not have to be hit with a big tax bill. ""This private equity money is going to allow them to sell up to 10%. So you're going to see some of these owners and a lot of these families take the money and use it for infrastructure, stadium, practice facilities.

Goldman Sachs Senior Equity Research Analyst Eric Sheridan joins Market Domination to discuss his outlook on the digital consumer. Sheridan notes that when it comes to the digital consumer, there isn't a ""black and white"" answer regarding the health of this segment. While acknowledging that consumer spending is slowing, Sheridan doesn't believe the economy is ""hurtling towards any kind of recession in terms of the digital consumer and the digital economy."" Regarding AI return on investment, Sheridan observes that cloud computing companies are seeing the most direct returns on AI spend. However, he notes that it will take longer to see returns in the consumer landscape. ""Most consumers have the same internet habits today that they had 18-24 months ago around the time that ChatGPT exploded,"" he states. Sheridan explains that it takes time for consumers to adjust their computing habits. So while enterprises are seeing immediate returns, it is normal for consumer adoption to lag behind. Watch the video above to hear which tech stock Sheridan recommends: Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) or Meta (META).

Goldman Sachs lead analyst Toshiya Hari is still bullish on the stock for a couple of reasons. First, he says, ""Demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong,"" adding that it's more than hyperscalers looking to buy Nvidia's chips. Second, he thinks the company's competitive positive is still strong. He also thinks the stock has an attractive valuation and that the sell-off has been overdone. Investors have been increasingly scrutinizing the amount of money Big Tech has been spending on AI without much return on investment so far. Hari agrees that companies ""need monetization for this to be sustainable,"" but he notes hyperscalers are seeing some return on those AI investments. He adds that if a lack of monetization becomes a problem, it will affect many companies, not just Nvidia. Watch the video above to hear what Hari has to say about companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) developing their own chips.

09/10/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,AWS CEO talks teaming up with Oracle & what's next for AI,"Amazon Web Services (AMZN) is teaming up with Oracle (ORCL) in a new strategic partnership, launching Oracle Database@AWS. AWS CEO Matt Garman says the partnership was driven by the desire to offer something unique and valuable to customers.  One big focus for AWS has been AI. Garman tells Yahoo Finance that, ""When the generative AI wave happened, we took a step back and said, 'How do customers really wanna get value out of that?' They want to really secure infrastructure. They have to worry about low cost. They want all of the best capabilities that are possible. And so then we went about and built an enterprise platform for customers to really drive AI into their applications. And what that means is it's not just one model. It's not just one feature. It's not just one particular application. It's a platform where you can use all of those capabilities."" He says that by utilizing a platform approach, customers can use a specific large-language model or several large-language models in a way that works best for them. On the perception that AWS may be perceived as lagging Microsoft (MSFT) in the AI race, Garman says, ""At Amazon we have a saying that we're willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time. And for us, we felt that it was more important to actually build a baseline platform that customers could really go build real enterprise value into their applications on, as opposed to rushing in and quickly getting out chatbot technology... But that's not really the eventual place that the value is gonna come from this technology. It's not just chatbots."" Watch the video above to hear Garman explain why there's ""a ton of potential"" for AWS chips.

""With every economic cycle, as we come out of an economic cycle, coincidentally, there's always a new tech cycle that also goes with it,"" Rangan tells Yahoo Finance. He explains that after the 2008 recession, tech companies came out with cloud products, which eventually became ""the catalyzing force for the tech industry."" He notes that for real growth, there needs to be innovation alongside economic improvement: ""It's not as easy as saying lower rates are good. I mean, they're kind of the first lift. It's the primer. The next thing, it has to be followed by real innovation."" At this moment for tech, he believes ""this game is about capital."" Cloud, just like AI, was ""capital-intensive,"" Rangan explains, and if companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) hadn't listened to investors, he argues that they wouldn't have the massive cloud businesses they have today. He adds, ""Now we're augmenting human capital, I don't know, $20, $30 trillion? That installed base of human capital is far more valuable. That's cognition capital than compute capital. So this cycle, if done well, is going to be huge."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

23/09/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Amazon and Alphabet catch up to Microsofts AI lead: Analyst,"Microsoft was among the hot stocks on Yahoo Finance's Trending Tickers page after D.A. Davidson downgraded the tech giant. D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria joins Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) competition among big tech companies. Luria tells Yahoo Finance that Microsoft (MSFT) ""had a big head start because they were involved with OpenAI for a long time. They knew ChatGPT was coming before everybody else. They knew that they were going to commercialize it. So about a year and a half ago, they came out with a whole set of commercial products around AI that gave them a big lead over Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL, GOOG) who were both caught flat-footed. Since then, Amazon and Google, [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] and [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)], respectively, have invested in catching up to Microsoft, and we think that you can start telling that they've caught up, both in terms of the results they've reported and the conversations we're having with industry participants tell us that their capabilities are now comparable to Azure's, thus diminishing the lead. Going forward, we think AWS and GCP have an advantage over Azure because they have the capability to deploy their own chips into their data centers, which are a fraction of the cost of an Nvidia GPU, something that Microsoft has yet to do with its own chips. He says, Microsoft is so reliant on Nvidia that it's almost transferring wealth from its own shareholders to Nvidia's (NVDA) shareholders. Their over-investment right now creates a point of margin headwind every year they over-invest, meaning Microsoft has to lay off 10,000 people just to keep its margins flat because of how much it's over-investing in building this infrastructure, using the most expensive chips, which are Nvidia GPUs. I'd say we're just at a point where they both [Nvidia and Microsoft] can't both win. Either Microsoft continues to over-invest in Nvidia GPUs, in which case Nvidia wins, but Microsoft has diminishing margins, or it slows down that rate of investment. He says the cooling down of investment could lead him to change his view on Microsoft. If they go back to a steady state of investment and expand data centers, but not at this exponential rate, that would take away that margin and headwind and position Microsoft for much faster earnings growth... if Microsoft actually cools off its investment, margins will grow, and they won't really sacrifice any revenue growth.

The Feds rate cuts create a benign environment for a megacap tech stocks¦If we replay the tape over the last two years, the beginning of 2022 was a terrible period for tech stocks, for long-duration assets, and because we went from zero to 100 or from 0% to 5% in terms of interest rates, [an] unprecedented spike in interest rates, and it really crushed the tech sector. We've had this pretty material outperformance in tech stocks, and now that the rates are starting to come down, that should help as well. I think a lot of this is anticipated into the stocks, but still a declining rate environment is generally good for long-duration assets like tech. The analyst lifted his price target for Amazon, highlighting the so-what factor for Amazon going forward is its Amazon Prime advertising opportunity. Amazon is so big as a company. It's kind of hard to hit a lot of home runs from here. It's all singles, really, but this is a good single. The company does about $50 billion a year in ad revenue. It's actually the third largest ad platform in the world and there's a lot of still unmonetized or lightly monetized areas [like] Amazon Prime Video¦ it's a great opportunity for Amazon to scale up another revenue stream."" The ˜so what of this is it's going to allow Amazon's ad revenue growth rate, which has been around 20%, to accelerate going into next year, and then this is very high margin business¦anything to boost the growth rates for either cloud or advertising is good for the business overall. He says, I call it the best mix shift story in tech, i.e., the fastest growing assets have the highest margins. It's good for Amazon's margins too. The analyst discusses the big bet that the company has made on live sports with Thursday Night Football¦There's just a lot more live sports content that's on Amazon and I think that's going to be one of the biggest investment areas for the company over the next three to five years, and you can monetize that.

24/09/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Amazon looks better in near term than Alphabet: Analyst,"As Alphabets (GOOG, GOOGL) antitrust woes continue, Evercore ISI managing director and head of internet research Mark Mahaney joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills on Catalysts to discuss risks to the Google parent company, including the antitrust case and artificial intelligence (AI) competition. There's a lot of uncertainty over Google, Mahaney says, adding that investors buying the stock have to be pretty long duration about it. The analyst, who maintains an Outperform rating on Alphabet, tells Yahoo Finance Amazon works better near term than Google does. Google's not one of my top three picks now, and it's sort of these two pincers on the stock. There's this concern about AI-driven competition, that's ChatGPT, and then there's concern about this [Department of Justice] regulation trials. Alphabet was found to hold a monopoly in search and is defending its ad business in a separate trial. Mahaney says the search case will likely be tied up in the court system for a long period, given expected appeals, with Google, he thinks, ultimately reaching a settlement or being ordered to stop paying traffic acquisition costs (TAC) to be the default search provider. Investors probably have a lot of protection in terms of your earnings estimates for the next couple of years, but you could well see a hit to your revenue estimates in the next couple of years,"" he says. ""I don't know if anybody has any huge visibility into this, but we'll get more as we go through the search trial, and the hearings over the remedies will get more of that in the next three to six months."" The analyst clarifies he sees the regulatory challenges as a bigger risk to Google than the AI competition concerns. Despite legal risks, Mahaney says theres an interesting long opportunity for Google. That's why we're sticking with it. We think [the] current valuation is also highly reasonable.

25/09/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Google calls out Microsoft for cloud monopoly in EU complaint,"Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) has filed a complaint with the European Commission against Microsoft (MSFT), accusing the software giant of using anticompetitive practices to attract customers to its Azure cloud platform. Adam Kovacevich, Founder & CEO of Chamber of Progress, joins Morning Brief to discuss the growing tension within Big Tech. Kovacevich notes that Google is expanding in the cloud computing space, aiming to compete with industry leaders like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft. He explains that Google's focus on Microsoft stems from contractual terms that ""lock in customers and make it difficult for competitors to gain traction."" However, he points out that this is ""not a new issue"" for Microsoft, nor is it the first time such concerns have been raised in the EU. ""This is a cold war that's gone hot between Google and Microsoft,"" Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance, noting that Microsoft has taken similar action against Google in the United States. He adds, ""I think one of the things you see here is Google punching back and saying 'look, Microsoft's contracts lock in cloud customers in the same way.'"" However, cloud computing does not have the same regulatory standards as other tech areas. ""This will be an interesting test of whether antitrust enforcers feel inclined to roll up their sleeves and take a closer look at the cloud computing market, which they haven't done to date,"" Kovacevich states.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Inside Brian Cornell's plan to get Target back on track,"Brian Cornell became the first external CEO hire in the history of Target (TGT) when he took the top job in 2014. Ten years in, Cornell has reinvented the company in many ways, experiencing the highs and lows of competing against other major retail giants like Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST). To get an inside look at the veteran CEOs journey and his plans for the future, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sat down with Cornell at a Target store in Jersey City, NJ. The two also met at a park that played a major role in Cornells upbringing in Queens, NY to explore what shaped him into the leader he is today. If you grow up the way I did, you always feel like the underdog, says Cornell. This mindset helped Cornell rise the retail ranks. He has served in executive roles at major companies like Safeway and Sams Club before running Target. Cornell took over when the retailer was struggling and coming off of a data breach. The CEOs first big move was to exit Canada, after the companys $5.4 billion venture north of the border failed to take off. In 2017 Cornell announced the $550 million acquisition of delivery company Shipt and a $7 billion investment in Target stores, at a time when the industry appeared to be shifting away from brick-and-mortar. These decisions paid off during the pandemic, when Targets revenue shot up past $100 billion for the first time in 2021. Recently, Target has missed the mark compared to competitors, with comparable sales falling for four straight quarters through the first quarter of 2024. Targets declining numbers were due to a number of factors, including retail theft, a backlash to Pride merchandise in 2023, and excess inventory resulting in price cuts, with the main driver being a slowdown in discretionary spending by consumers. Nearly 50% of Targets product portfolio is made up of non-essentialsmuch higher than many competitors. To drive growth into the future, Cornell and Target are mixing strategies old and new. The company plans to invest in 300 stores over the next decade, continuing a trend under Cornell. In April of 2024 Target announced a paid membership program, Target Circle 360, to compete with Amazon Prime and Walmart+. The most recent numbers showed positive signs for the retailer, with sales up 2.7% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024. Target is set to report third quarter earnings on November 20, where the company expects to see more growth, albeit at a slower rate.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Target CEO is fighting back against retail theft and winning,"Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell took the retailers top job in 2014, at a time when the business was struggling and coming off of a large data breach. Over the majority of Cornells tenure, Target has held its own against rivals Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT). Cornell led the company to a revenue increase of nearly 50% from 2015 to 2022, peaking at over $109B as part of a pandemic-related spending surge. Since that peak, Target sales and profits have dipped due to a decline in discretionary spending among consumers, and other factors, including retail theft. In 2022 alone, inventory shrinkage, mostly in the form of retail theft, shaved off $700M from the companys profits. Following a wave of high-profile ˜smash and grabs, including several at Target stores, Target and other retailers have leaned in to increased security and technology to not only reduce and deter theft but to make stores safer and more accessible for customers. These efforts, along with government involvement, are already having an impact, according to Cornell. I feel so much better today than I did a year ago, and I think it comes back to support at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level, Cornell says. To be clear, we do not like locking up product, but we like running stores and we want to keep our stores open. We want to make sure they're safe.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Why Tesla is a better EV play than Rivian: Good Buy or Goodbye,"Hamilton Capital chief investment officer Alonso Munoz joins the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye to discuss his best and worst picks in the electric vehicle industry. Munoz points to Tesla (TSLA) as a good buy, explaining that the company's autonomous driving initiatives will be key to its next phase of growth. While other companies, like Waymo, are rolling out their own robotaxis, Munoz believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition as it has much more data to train its vehicles. However, he points to potential regulatory and policy risks down the line. He also highlights its improving financials, believing the company has ""a lot of cash to deliver on their product roadmap."" He expects third quarter deliveries to come in between 460,000 and 470,000. Munoz notes that Tesla is ""not just a car company."" He is bullish on its energy businesses, highlighting the ""explosive"" second quarter revenue growth. ""That's something that gets us excited away from just the selling of vehicles. And the auto industry has had some struggles over the last couple of years in this macro environment, but also with higher rates. So their diversified business lines and revenue there gets us very excited,"" he explains. Meanwhile, Munoz is bearish on Rivian (RIVN), telling Yahoo Finance, ""They need a lot of cash. This is a scale industry, and very recently, this summer, they partnered with Volkswagen (VWAGY). They got $5 billion to roll out the next phase of their growth, which is lower-cost vehicles. And so this is something that we're looking at. It's an unprofitable business. They lose money for every car that they make, and we're in an environment where consumers have preferences and there are options."" In addition, Rivian is facing production challenges. Last month, the company paused the production of its electric delivery vehicles for Amazon (AMZN) one of its biggest customers. Munoz also notes that production declined last quarter, and while it appears as if the company will meet its targets, it's enough to make him feel ""uncomfortable."" Finally, he argues that Rivian's offerings are not only narrow but too expensive relative to other EV players. Coupled with production challenges, he adds, ""They have to get these vehicles out to market to get sales to drive revenue, to hopefully become a profitable company. And they expect to do that by 2026. We don't know if they're going to make it."" Munoz concludes, ""If they can lower their cost, if they can leverage their partnership with Volkswagen, and they can crank production up and get cars on the streets, I think that would be really positive for Rivian over the long run.""

10/09/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,"Small business reports, housing market, travel spending: Wealth!","On today's episode of Wealth!, Host Brad Smith breaks down key stories you need to know, from Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report to the state of small businesses. Wall Street is bracing for Thursday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge is expected to show cooling inflation. The month-over-month CPI is projected to be 0.1%, down from August's 0.2%. The year-over-year reading is anticipated to drop to 2.3% from August's 2.5%. Meanwhile, Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have a month-over-month rate of 0.2%, down from August's 0.3%. The year-over-year core rate is projected to hold steady at 3.2%, unchanged from August. Winthrop Capital Management CIO Adam Coons notes that current inflation data is ""making it difficult"" for investors to anticipate the Federal Reserve's next move. While the recent jobs report exceeded expectations, he points out that revisions have trended downward, creating ""a tough place"" for the Fed. Although Coons supported the Fed's initial 50-basis-point cut, he believes that moving forward, the central bank will ""play it safe"" and implement just one 25-basis-point cut for the remainder of the year. Median job switchers see a 10% increase in pay, but their retirement savings rate often drops nearly 1%, according to a Vanguard report. Vanguard Investment Strategy Group head of retirement research Kelly Hahn encourages taking more ownership of your retirement planning to avoid losing the savings momentum. This means not only laying out your savings goals, but understanding what your employer is offering in terms of retirement plans and benefits. When switching jobs, Hahn emphasizes the importance of understanding how that retirement plan may change and whether it affects your savings goals. The NFIB Small Business Uncertainty Index hit a record high as small business owners report persistent inflation pressures and uncertainty around the upcoming election. NFIB Research Center executive director Holly Wade explains that uncertainty ""hit an all-time high for our 50-year survey, and a lot of that has to do with the uncertainty around the election [and] what that means for small business[es] moving forward, what type of environment they'll be operating in. And they're facing a big tax hike, possibly at the end of 2025. So all of that is weighing on small businesses."" Meanwhile, H&R Block unveiled its 2024 State of Women Small Business Report, which uncovers findings from over 6,000 applicants of its Fund Her Future Small Business Grant program. Jamil Khan, H&R Block chief strategy and small business officer, tells Yahoo Finance, ""So interestingly, there's a really high level of optimism and confidence about the next year. When they think about the business, their financial position over the next year, they feel really good. Having said that, there's a little bit of a contrast. There's also some concerns around inflation, and over the next year, as you can see in the data here, 44% feel they may be forced to cut expenses and also will need to raise prices again. But despite that, there still is a lot of optimism about the next year and the future state of their business."" Candy Valentino, business and wealth growth expert and author of ""The 9% Edge: The Life-Changing Secrets to Create More Revenue for Your Business and More Freedom for Yourself,"" joins Brad Smith to share strategies to help women build wealth.

Research indicates that it's a $300 billion market a year, and that's just the beginning of it. The market continues to grow, the market continues to expand. And if you add what people actually are doing on their weekends, it's a $1.7 trillion market. So it's one of these generational shifts where people spend less and less on physical goods and more and more on experiences.""

US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm joins Market Domination to discuss this energy transition and its implications. Granholm explains that AI data centers are still in their building phase, and it's ""not going to happen overnight."" She notes an increase in ""hyperscalers"" entering power purchase agreements with utility companies to ""get them across the finish line."" The Energy Department, she adds, is focused on ensuring these data centers are powered by clean energy as the transition progresses. Highlighting the potential of SMRs, Granholm explains, ""Those are able to... be virtually connected to a data center to be able to power that center with clean baseload power, not intermittent power,"" adding she is ""excited about this movement."" However, she acknowledges the challenge of widespread SMR adoption, noting that tech companies need an ""nth of a kind experience,"" explaining, ""nobody wants to be the one to buy the first one."" ""If all of these tech companies kind of band together and not ask for different designs, different specifications, but if they can agree on basic power, then you can order a six pack or a 12 pack of these small modular reactors and be able to power your data centers,"" Granholm states, noting rising interest from Big Tech in these reactors to be able to ""bring their own power with them.""

24/10/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,What do Tesla and IBM earnings signal about Big Tech next week?,"IBM (IBM) shares are under pressure after releasing mixed third quarter results showing artificial intelligence (AI) and software growth with weakness in other areas. Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off Magnificent Seven earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBMs earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated ¦ It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that. While IBMs mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being kind of clumped into the Magnificent Seven group. Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group. He notes that the positive reaction to Teslas earnings adds to the good momentum that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have some indication of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.

Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, joins Morning Brief to discuss what these results mean for the rest of the Magnificent Seven earnings and overall market leadership heading into 2025. Yoshioka explains that there is a greater emphasis on tech sector earnings given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and weight within the Magnificent Seven. However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters."" With AI still being early in its development, Yoshioka argues that it's ""going to be a while"" before seeing real competition among hyperscalers and chip companies.

OptionsPlay senior options strategist Brian Overby tells Yahoo Finance that trading options around earnings is ""always going to be speculative in nature."" He says one of the biggest things traders will want to establish is ""what the expected move is after that earnings report. And the marketplace will tell you that just by looking at the nearest term option contract."" Overby explains how he would position for Amazon (AMZN) ahead of its results on Oct. 31. ""Amazon is looking for an expected move of around 6.5%, which is really about 12 points. So if I'm setting up a trade where I want to be bullish or bearish, because you got to realize it has nothing to do with if the market's going to go up or down, it's just saying that after the earnings report, the marketplace is looking for a move of about that nature. So you want to fit that into your forecast. So Amazon, they're going to be announcing on Thursday. The Friday option contracts got one one day to live. And I'm looking at doing a long call spread going into that earnings date. And I want to make sure that the strike that I'm selling in that position is going to be within that expected move. And that's how you should always approach these speculative trades around earnings.""

Next week, five of the Magnificent Seven names  Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL)  are reporting quarterly earnings. That's obviously a huge deal, not just for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and related indexes, but also for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), the strategist says, noting that the results could feed the debate back and forth between, are we going to get a more cyclical kind of rebound because the economy is stronger or more of that kind of defensive growth trade that we've seen really over the last 18 months. On top of continued third quarter earnings results, the market will also get new data that could provide insight into the state of the US economy and the Federal Reserves next move at the November meeting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday with fresh non-farm payroll data on Friday, November 1. Investors will also get the first cut of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2024 on Wednesday. Amid uncertainties, Hill says he does expect markets to go higher. There's a lot of reasons to worry, like rates staying higher for longer and the election, among other factors, but really when we cut through a lot of that noise, we focus on the primarily on the health of the underlying economy, because that's going to drive earnings and ultimately that's going to dictate the path for risk assets. We still see that, broadly speaking, as being something that's that's very supportive. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

11/05/2024,00:00:00,AMZN,Constellation Energy's dip is buying opportunity into nuclear: Analyst,"Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) have fallen as much as 12% today in tandem with other nuclear energy names, after government regulators blocked Amazon's (AMZN) power agreement with provider Talen Energy (TLN). CFRA Equity Analyst Daniel Rich joined Catalysts to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear energy future as companies search for clean methods to power their AI data centers. ""It certainly is a setback,"" Rich tells Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills, but it's far from over. The CFRA analyst notes that the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) decision was split, and it ""wouldn't be surprising"" for there to be a rehearing shortly.  Though the regulatory roadblock adds a bit of near-term uncertainty, Rich is still ""pretty favorable"" on Constellation Energy and its peers given the interest from Big Tech  Amazon, Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all announced investments in nuclear power. ""Whatever happens with the [FERC] decision, we think Constellation is in a pretty good spot,"" Rich says, adding that today's sell-off in shares presents a viable buying opportunity for investors. The regulatory news overshadowed Constellation Energy's robust third quarter results out Monday morning. The energy giant raised its full year adjusted operating earnings guidance after topping Wall Street's expectations for operating revenue by more than $1 billion. In the earnings release, Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez lays out ""the importance of AI and the data economy to Americas economic competitiveness and national security cant be overstated."" CFRA maintains its Buy opinion on Constellation shares, but lowered the 12-month price target by $25 to $280 per share citing the uncertainty from the FERC decision. Even with Monday's drop, Constellation Energy stock is up more than 90% this year and is among the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 (^GSPC).

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues  especially in the antitrust arena  for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

Mahoney tells retail investors, ""Don't get involved in this. You know there's a lot of emotion, and I know it's easy for me to say that, but the last thing you want to do is get whipsawed out of your position ...

The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

Discovery (WBD) and the NBA reaching a lawsuit settlement over sports broadcast rights, FanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment's (FLUT) strong earnings results, and the Formula 1 Grand Prix returning to Las Vegas. This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano breaks down these top sports headlines. ""Warner Bros. Discovery sued the NBA after losing out on their media rights package earlier this year... Warner Bros. is going to be getting a few additional assets, and the NBA is going to be moving on with its new partner Amazon (AMZN),"" Pompliano explains. ""This is sort of a win-win for everyone because the NBA gets to move on with Amazon. ESPN gets Inside the NBA from Warner Bros. who's going to be licensing them the wildly successful show and Warner Brothers is now going to get to sub-license some college football and college basketball games from ESPN. Again, a win for everyone involved."" FanDuel parent company Flutter Entertainment saw 27% revenue growth year-over-year in the third quarter. Pompliano puts the sports bettor's $114 million net loss and total revenue of $3.25 billion into context, as platforms like FanDuel and DraftKings move closer to profitability as more states adopt sports betting. The Formula 1 Grand Prix is returning to Las Vegas after pulling off a successful race in 2023. The Las Vegas Grand Prix 2024 will take place from November 21 to 23. The Formula 1 Grand Prix ""was a huge event last year,"" Pompliano explains, ""Liberty Media invested more than $500 million into a permanent paddock building that's 300,000 square feet right off the Las Vegas strip. They had a ton of people attend the event, and it reportedly brought in a $1.5 billion economic impact with visitors alone spending $864 million.""

The second stage is ""the application phase of the cycle, which should benefit software companies as well as the cloud providers.

""One of the, I think, good pieces of news is that President-elect Trump has appointed a number of people from the tech world, venture capitalists, people with tech experience to prominent positions,"" Kovacevic says, noting that this is a ""good sign"" for the industry. He adds that Trump's second term will likely lead to a shift in the US government's attitude toward AI. The Biden administration's ""main approach to artificial intelligence was to say, 'This is an area where we ought to tread carefully, put up guardrails, and focus on safety,'"" Kovacevic says. ""What I think you are going to see with Trump is a pivot from safety to really [seeing] AI as an economic asset for the United States, a national asset for the United States, where we should go out and beat other countries, particularly China in AI.""

Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. ""I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer,"" he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: ""We have become a value-oriented consumer society."" Retailers like Ross (ROST), Walmart (WMT), and Target (TGT) are experiencing consistent foot traffic as shoppers seek bargains. This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that ""the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar."" Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as ""great news,"" describing the retailer as ""the gold standard"" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies.

01/03/2025,00:00:00,AMZN,Can the Magnificent 7 keep dominating in 2025?,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike ORourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. ORourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value.

Tigay notes that Tesla is a leader in the world of electric vehicles (EVs) and is likely to receive favorable treatment from the new presidential administration. This may be bolstered by the fact that reduced EV spending overall is anticipated under Trump 2.0, positioning Tesla to be the winner of the sector. Beyond Tesla's EVs, Tigay highlights the company's battery sector as a promising revenue stream in the future. ""I think that's going to be a big player going forward in the next four years,"" he says. , among other signs that Bezos has been fostering an amicable relationship with the president-elect. These moves note a shift from the historical feud between Bezos and Trump.Amazon is another one of Tigay's top picks, partly due to Jeff Bezos' recent financial support of Trumphttps://finance.yahoo.com...
