Third Bridge Group sector analyst Jamie Lumley and Manhattan Venture Partners head of research Santosh Rao join Market Domination to discuss what's next for the media giant. Lumley notes that Paramount+ trails behind other streaming competitors, the company might consider Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) or Max as a ""good partnership."" Rao adds that consolidation has become a ""requirement"" in the sector as he believes it's necessary to scale. ""As we think over the last few years, this streaming space overall has lost billions and billions of dollars. And it's clear that while there might be some companies here which can reach profitability, it is unlikely that all of them will be able to rebuild these streaming companies or these streaming businesses to offset, for the traditional media companies, the declining revenue and earnings that they had on the traditional linear businesses,"" Lumley says. He adds that bundling services is a way to retain customers and become profitable. Santosh believes that consolidation is ""not going to be a threat"" in the sector: ""There's not going to be a monopoly of search. It's sustainability. And these companies will just not last.

Comscore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian joins Asking for a Trend to break down some of the key themes hitting movie theaters this summer. Dergarabedian notes that the box office had a rather slow start to the summer, however, it started to pick up in early June with Bad Boys: Ride or Die opening beyond expectations at around $57.5 million. Then, animated features Inside Out 2 and Despicable Me 4 helped pick up momentum as the industry recovers from its pandemic slump and last year's WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. He adds that going to the theater is ""relatively inexpensive to other outside-of-the-home activities,"" and it provides a ""communal and immersive experience"" compared to streaming movies at home. He points to the ""Barbenheimer"" craze last year as an excellent example of a communal experience and viral moment driving people to theaters. As Wicked and Gladiator II are both set to release on November 22 in the US, there could be another double-feature moment that emulates what happened with Barbie and Oppenheimer.

17/07/2024,00:00:00,DIS,Streamers are doubling down on advertising. Here's why.,"As advertisers begin to focus on digital spaces, what does this mean for media companies and how will they make that adjustment? What does it mean for the overall media landscape? University of Michigan Ross School of Business marketing professor Marcus Collins joins Wealth! alongside Yahoo Finance senior reporter Alexandra Canal to discuss how streamers are doubling down on advertising. Collins says that customers are turning to streaming due to its lower cost and content selection. They also aren't as locked into a subscription, so it allows customers to switch between services when they want. Collins adds, ""I think that marketers and brands underwrite everything, right?... The irony of all this is that the streaming model is essentially getting closer to a cable model, just augmented with the agency of allowing subscribers to put up more money to circumvent the ads, or to say, 'I'm going to take the ads so that I don't have to pay.' Essentially, what this is getting to is the closer and closer we get to providing consumers more agency, more flexibility, and more freedom, the business models that are built for that will be the ones that essentially will win out in the end.""

The cyberattack on CDK Global, the software provider for car dealerships across the US and Canada, led to system outages for auto dealers across North America. Meanwhile, prices for new cars remain well above pre-pandemic levels. CoPilot founder and CEO Pat Ryan explains that the hack ""really threw the industry back to the Stone Age in a lot of ways because with the systems locked down, they [car dealerships] couldn't do business the way they are."" He also points to ""structural increases in car prices"" leading to consumer pressures: ""We're still up over 30% from pre-COVID. So there's sticker shock for people who have bought a car since before COVID. And then when you add in that most cars are bought with financing, about 80% of cars. And so when your car is bought with financing, interest rates go up and prices go up. That has a compounding effect that has really made them unaffordable."" The tech sector was dealt a major blow in Wednesday's trading session as chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM), and ASML Holding (ASML) sank in the day's session. Meanwhile, signs of a so-called ""Trump Trade"" are ringing throughout Wall Street, specifically with interest in M&A activity which could see a pullback if the former president were to take the White House once again.

07/08/2024,00:00:00,DIS,2 reasons why Disney's CFO isn't too worried about the parks,"The Walt Disney Company (DIS) reported its third quarter results revealing its streaming service was profitable for the first time, but its theme park unit fell short of sales and profit expectations. The Walt Disney Company CFO Hugh Johnston joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to give insight into the company's earnings. Johnston says the parks business may face headwinds for another couple of quarters, but that the company expects it to bounce back. He also points to Disney's ""creative engine really getting back on track,"" noting the company's recent success at the box office. In regards to the strength of the consumer, Johnston believes: ""We certainly see consumers behaving in a way, I wouldn't call it recessionary necessarily. They're watching their pennies a little bit more."" In terms of how the company may change operating with its theme park unit, Johnston claims: ""Number one, we are putting a tight clamp on our cost management. We're usually good at that in the parks and we're taking it up to another level. Number two, we're being very selective about creating value offerings for certain consumers that are more sensitive to value these days, but doing it in a responsible way, not in a way that's going to be disruptive to the financials of the company. When you put those things together, given the strength of the IP that we have, given that people do tend to protect their vacations more than other types of spending, we tend to get hit late, we tend to get hit less, and we tend to improve more quickly than others."" Johnston credits Disney's box office resurgence to CEO Bob Iger's willingness to scrap or delay projects that aren't working, therefore improving the quality of the product. Johnston admits that Disney may have been ""a little too aggressive on quantity"" when it launched its streaming product and that quality may have suffered a bit, saying it's something Iger has been focused on fixing.

Earlier this year, Disney and Comcast hired investment bank RBC Capital as the independent appraiser to resolve a dispute  over how to value the 33% stake in the streaming platform, according to people familiar with the matter.  Reuters was first to report in May that Disney and Comcast were seeking to hire an independent adviser.",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=65a11af1b3feb46da90d756c72e9df309f64d82dbc53352d4fa75f03fca5cd78,1723044453
07/08/2024,00:00:00,DIS,Disney struggling to align its businesses for growth: Analyst,"Shares of Disney (DIS) are slipping as weakness in the company's parks division weighed on its third quarter results. However, the entertainment giant's streaming division turned a profit for the first time ever. CFRA research director of equity research Ken Leon joins Catalysts to break down Disney's third quarter earnings report and its overall outlook in a changing media environment. After Disney's earnings, CFRA lowered its price target on the company to $98 from $100 and reaffirmed its Hold rating. Leons explains, ""It's extremely difficult to get all of Disney's businesses moving in the right direction for corporate growth. Additionally, moving into a softer economy and a consumer that is watching their budgets, the parks got hurt."" He adds that while the streaming business turned a profit, ""the numbers are very small. So in aggregate, they have a lot of challenges."" Therefore, he does not see much opportunity for investors in the near-term as Disney struggles to align its businesses for positive growth. He adds, ""Shareholders are not getting healthy returns on investment or buybacks in a big way. It's just really challenging against more streamlined companies like Netflix (NFLX) that are really ahead of the curve in this area of streaming. It's a very tough area to compete."" He argues that it has become increasingly difficult to ""hold on and grow in the traditional areas for general entertainment,"" and does not expect Disney to report outsized growth in all of their areas for profitability in the fourth quarter.

He also points to Spotify (SPOT) as a top player in music streaming.† ""Advertisers follow where viewership is growing, which is the continued pivot from legacy networks,"" Leon says.

Therefore, traditional media giants are now competing against platforms like Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube TV and TikTok. As Disney (DIS) may have to pay $5 billion more to buy Comcast's (CMCSA) stake in Hulu, Leon explains that CEO Bob Iger is ""looking at streaming besides sports and saying we need general entertainment. So Hulu rounds out our offering along with our family Disney+. That's where we are. The deal will get done."" He anticipates the deal to close by January, and while it may be a significant move for Disney, he adds, ""I'm not sure that's a driver or a catalyst for the stock.""

SoundHound AI Co-Founder & CEO Keyvan Mohajer discusses the recent purchase of another AI-based company: ""We bought an amazing company. We announced it this morning. It's called Amelia, they specialize in conversational AI for customer service...And they are in different verticals that we wanted to go after. That's a big part of our business, it's a big part of our growth"". He adds, ""We are now able to go into verticals that we wanted to go to, and that path is now accelerated. Now we were in restaurants, we were supporting smaller businesses, but now we are in healthcare. We are in financial services, insurance, hospitality and retail."" Wall Street is getting mixed signals from the labor market as the unemployment rate signals a recession while initial jobless claims suggest the contrary. Market Domination co-host Julie Hyman breaks down the historical comparisons between recessions and these data points, and what it could signal about the future of the US economy. Finally, Asking for a Trend host Josh Lipton breaks down some of the names moving the most in after-hours trading, from Sweetgreen (SG) to Paramount (PARA, PARAA).

Venrock Partner Nick Beim explains, ""I think there's a boom in the global defense industry generally. We've got wars in Europe and the Middle East.

13/08/2024,00:00:00,DIS,Disney is investing in parks for the next generation: Analyst,"Disney (DIS) held its D23 2024 Expo over the weekend, unveiling first looks at some upcoming shows and movies and announcing billions of dollars in theme park expansions. Rosenblatt Securities managing director Barton Crockett joins Market Domination to discuss Disney's outlook and the state of the overall media industry. ""Disney gets most of its cash flow, a large portion of its value, the majority of its value, I think, from its theme parks. And what was concerning was the turn of the theme parks that we saw in this past quarter, where they had gone from predicting robust growth in operating income, to really expecting some pressure. And that's really in over the past month or two that the consumer has really turned,"" Crockett explains. He notes that parks are one of Disney's ""iconic assets,"" and as seen at the D23 Expo, the company is investing for the ""next generation of families that will bring their kids."" Amid heated streaming wars, Crockett says, ""We've been more constructive on Disney, but that's really on asset value long term anchored on the theme parks, which was challenged this past quarter with the near-term kind of headwinds. So it's a difficult space."" He explains that Netflix (NFLX) ""is clearly running away with the ball,"" and other media companies are struggling to keep up.

Wolf notes that streaming services ""started off with you paying a monthly fee with no ads, and then they've been able to make it cheaper with ads."" He continues, ""a lot of people think, well, they've made it cheaper. And actually, they're making more money for those tiers that have ads. And so we're forecasting for, by the time we get to the end of this year, there'll be roughly $6 billion of advertising on these streaming services. And I'm talking about Disney (DIS) and Hulu and Netflix (NFLX). And within three years, it's going to be $15 billion."" He believes that moving forward, ad tiers will end up being bigger than non-ad tiers because they are a better deal for consumers and it is ultimately more profitable for streaming companies.

Discovery (WBD), and Disney (DIS), which was set to launch next week. Activate Consulting founder and CEO Michael Wolf joins Asking for a Trend to discuss the news. Wolf explains that Venu's expectation is ""not a wall, it's a speed bump."" He continues, ""You almost have to step back and look at what's Fubo versus what they're going to launch,"" and calls Fubo a ""virtual cable company"" where customers can watch all networks for between $80 and $100 a month. On the other hand, Venu is about $42 per month and only offers sports. ""We can understand this from the Fubo perspective. They think it's going to hurt them. But for the most part, this is something different. And also, we should expect that there's going to be a lot more bundling across these services. So already, Verizon is selling a package of Netflix (NFLX) and Max. I mean, we're going to see more of this bundling and it's inevitable. This is what consumers are going to want,"" Wolf concludes.

Just before closing a deal with Skydance Media, the company opted to review an offer from billionaire Edgar Bronfman Jr.  Third Bridge Group sector analyst Jamie Lumley explains that Bronfman's offer does give a little more cash to average shareholders and lets the studio remain as it is. The Skydance offer, on the other hand, does include a studio integration. It also has protections for controlling stakeholder Shari Redstone.† Lumley also points out that Skydance benefits from having the Ellison family money, while Bronfman had to get many parties on board for his offer.† When it comes to Paramount selling assets, Lumley says it does help the company streamline its business. He notes the company's decision to write down its cable business for nearly $6 billion, calling it a ""business in free fall, so it's trying to pivot as quickly as possible, cut costs, and really put everything into producing world-class content and focusing on streaming.""

11/09/2024,00:00:00,DIS,"Apple, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney: What's next for the stocks?","Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi and Catalysts Host Madison Mills sit down with Goldman Sachs senior equity research analyst Michael Ng at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Tech Conference to discuss the state of media and tech companies, from Apple (AAPL) to Disney (DIS). On Monday, Apple (AAPL) unveiled its newest product offerings at its highly anticipated ""It's Glowtime"" event in Cupertino, California. Ng explains that the event ""delivered in line with investor expectations,"" noting that historically, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 by 70 basis points on announcement days, and following the event, it underperformed by about 100 basis points. ""We think that was in line with historical events. And when you look at the individual product announcements, it came in mostly as expected,"" he adds. Ng reiterates his Buy rating on Apple, arguing that ""there's an underappreciated uplift in their normalized earnings power as more people start to upgrade their iPhones."" He continues, ""We think that investors have historically thought about Apple iPhones at a normalized sell-through rate at about 225 to 230 million units. And we think that AI and some of the new product features that are going to get rolled out over the next few years is going to bring that normalized run rate closer to 250 to 260 million."" While there is debate among investors as to whether AI will be the demand driver for Apple, Ng is bullish on the technology. He also highlights that hardware changes will also drive an upgrade cycle as screen sizes increase, devices become thinner, and rumors that the iPhone 18 may potentially be foldable. Turning to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Ng believes that the company is managing its video business holistically. ""The linear TV network business is certainly having challenges. Cord cutting is unrelenting, and paid TV subscriber declines will continue to occur. That being said, it's an incredibly cash-generative business and it helps to fund growth investments elsewhere in the Warner Brothers portfolio,"" he explains. He points to momentum in its streaming platform Max, and argues that ""there's a crown jewel in the Warner Brothers film and television studio."" Meanwhile, Ng believes that one of Disney's (DIS) biggest challenges will be its succession planning. Investors have praised the company's growth under CEO Bob Iger, and Ng notes that before Iger's return to the company, Disney faced ""a few missteps,"" especially in its film and TV divisions. ""I think there's a tremendous amount of focus on what that succession planning looks like. One observation that I'll make is that they have an incredibly deep bench of talented executives across each of their business lines, theme parks, film and TV studios, and obviously at ESPN,"" Ng tells Yahoo Finance.

27/09/2024,00:00:00,DIS,"Super Micro Computer DOJ probe, streaming wars: Market Domination","On today's episode of Market Domination, Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton break down some of the biggest stories from the trading day, from fresh labor market data to the state of the streaming wars. Initial jobless claims (the number of people filing for new unemployment applications) hit a four-month low, according to the latest Labor Department data. Michael Darda, Roth Capital Partners chief economist and macro strategist tells Yahoo Finance, If you look at first-time claims in isolation, it really doesn't look like there's anything wrong with this labor market whatsoever. Unfortunately, that is not the whole story.ù The latest labor market differential report, which shows the difference between the share of consumers who view jobs as plentifulù compared to those who view jobs as hard to get,ù fell to its lowest reading since March 2021. Darda says the recent decline in the labor market differential would be consistent with the unemployment rate continuing to creep [up], eventually towards 5% and that would throw us back into the recession alarm bell camp.ù Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) are plummeting after a report from the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities. On the other hand, chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC) are rising in sympathy with Micron (MU) after it issued strong first quarter guidance. A new report from Bain & Company forecasts substantial growth in the AI product market in the coming years. The firm projects that the market for AI-related hardware and software could expand by 40-50% annually, reaching approximately $990 billion by 2027. Bain & Company global technology and cloud services practice chairman David Crawford sees three ""broad pockets of growth"" for AI. First, large hyperscalers building out their capabilities are generating ""enormous"" demand. The second pocket for growth lies in enterprise adoption. The third growth area will likely be seen in independent software vendors that build AI capabilities for their products and run them in their own data centers. As the streaming wars heat up, Macquarie US equity research senior media tech analyst Tim Nollen remains Neutral on one of the biggest players: Disney (DIS). Nollen explains that there are several areas that will ""hit Disney's PNL (profit and loss) balance sheet and cash flows over the next couple of years."" However, ESPN direct-to-consumer will be the biggest factor. He calls this ""the largest event in the streaming landscape"" since the launch of Disney+, and believes that offering ESPN direct-to-consumer will likely cause cord-cutting to accelerate. Yet, he remains Neutral on the company until there are clearer projections about the success of ESPN direct-to-consumer.

Nollen explains that there are several areas that will ""hit Disney's PNL (profit and loss) balance sheet and cash flows over the next couple of years."" He elaborates, ""This includes some incremental sports rights from the NBA, rights renewal, college football expansion, some of the India business coming off of the PNL, probably next quarter. But primarily, it's about the launch of the ESPN direct-to-consumer service (DTC)."" Disney plans to launch an ESPN DTC service in August 2025, where users can get ESPN within Disney+. Nollen calls this ""the largest event in the streaming landscape"" since the launch of Disney+. He argues, ""If there's one thing that's keeping consumers on pay TV, it's sports. A lot of sports is now available on streaming services, and ESPN is the largest streaming service. So ESPN going completely over-the-top (OTT) direct-to-consumer, I think is a very, very meaningful event for the pay TV landscape."" He believes that offering ESPN direct-to-consumer will likely cause cord-cutting to accelerate: ""By our calculations, cord-cutting means about 8.5% of consumers are dropping pay TV every year, and that includes some of the virtual addbacks like Hulu Live or YouTube TV. 8.5% is probably going to go to maybe like 15% or so once ESPN direct-to-consumer hits the market over the subsequent quarters."" Nollen adds, ""So the big question is, can Disney offset that decline with new ESPN direct-to-consumer additions?"" Thus, he remains Neutral on Disney until there are clearer projections about the success of ESPN direct-to-consumer.

22/10/2024,00:00:00,DIS,"Disney, Bob Iger trying to get succession right this time around","Disney (DIS) is set to name a successor to interim CEO Bob Iger in early 2026; Iger's contract is set to expire at the end of 2026. Meanwhile, the media giant has tapped former Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman to become the board's chairman in January 2025. Gorman has led Disney's succession planning committee and will exit his role as Morgan Stanley's executive chairman for this opportunity. ""What Iger has been telling people is that whenever they identify his successor, he wants to stick around to kind of help guide them, to help them learn the ropes, because it's really impossible for any new CEO to understand all the different parts of Disney,"" Hollywood Reporter media and business writer Alex Weprin tells Josh Lipton and Jared Blikre. Weprin believes Iger wants to ""leave a good impression"" after retiring in 2021 and being forced to return as chief executive after the ousting of his initial successor, Bob Chapek. He speculates whether the Disney board will face future pressures from activist investors in this timeline to find and name a new CEO.

09/11/2024,00:00:00,DIS,Media M&A unlikely to see uptick under Trump: CFRA analyst,"Following Donald Trump's reelection as the 47th President of the United States, media companies are closely monitoring potential regulatory changes that could affect merger and acquisition (M&A) prospects within the streaming space. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav expressed optimism about potential industry changes, noting earlier this week that ""it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation"" that could be ""positive"" and accelerate the industry. CFRA Director of Global Fundamental Research Ken Leon tells Morning Brief that in the streaming space, legacy TV companies are ""trying to catch up to Netflix (NFLX);"" however, ""it's a really tough battle."" He emphasizes that ""overshadowing"" this dilemma are Big Tech companies increasingly entering the streaming space with their own platforms. ""I don't think you're going to see these mega-mergers of... companies that are declining,"" he tells Yahoo Finance, adding that ""technology has created a very different business model that's hard for some of these companies to catch up."" Leon suggests that while a second Trump administration's regulatory policies might create a more merger-friendly environment in the space, the likelihood of large enterprises in the streaming sector being bought out or entering major deals is ""probably not likely."" While discussing earnings results from Paramount Global (PARA, PARAA) and WBD, Leon looks ahead to the expectations for Disney's (DIS) fiscal fourth quarter; Disney will report earnings on Thursday, November 14.

Disney CEO Bob Iger has said that Netflix (NFLX) is ""the gold standard when it comes to streaming"" and what Disney+ strives to be. Tomicki tells Yahoo Finance that he thinks Netflix-level results are ""possible,"" but ""it requires a complete rethink of how you create content and what is the definition of great content."" He explains that the company needs shows like Netflix's ""Too Hot to Handle,"" saying, ""What matters is that people keep watching and are hooked to your platform and are willing to pay for it, so the thinking has to change.

14/11/2024,00:00:00,DIS,Disney CFO on earnings beat: 'The magic is back at Disney',"Disney (DIS) shares are trading higher after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided strong guidance. Disney CFO Hugh Johnston sits down with Yahoo Financeôs Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the print and what's next for the company. The CFO tells Yahoo Finance there are a couple of things going on right now,ù saying, Obviously, 2024 was a terrific year, and Q4 was a great cap to a terrific year, 6% revenue growth, 21% [return on investment] ROI and then, of course, 39% [earning per share] EPS growth.ù Johnston adds, In terms of the way we thought about the business, we've got two back-to-back billion-dollar movies. We've got terrific things going on with women's college basketball and college football. So, [we] certainly feel great about all of that. In addition to that, the streaming service now has turned significantly profitable for two quarters in a row. And then, of course, we had a record year in the experiences business. And then, last but not least, streaming. We added about six million subs over the third quarter. So I think it's a combination of all of those factors and the portfolio working.ù The fact that we've been investing in those things as well is, and the fact that we've got sort of good visibility into the future is what has led us to provide forward guidance and, I think, the confidence that we have in those investments, whether it's the investments in streaming or the investments in the experiences business, is what's leading investors to basically look at the guidance and say, 'Yeah, this is something that that we're really bought into.ô We feel very positively about it,ù he says. Johnston explains that the strategy under CEO Bob Igerôs leadership is to focus on quality content rather than quantity. A few years ago, we were producing a lot of content to try to fill the streaming service, and we stretched ourselves in some ways, probably too thin. One of the things that Bob Iger said when he came back is I want to put creativity back into the center ¶ I do think that that focus on raising the bar on quality and delivering, really, I think, the best content in the industry is, is an indication that the magic is back at Disney.""

Several streamers have pushed into live sports to drive consumers to their streaming services and bundled offerings.

15/11/2024,00:00:00,DIS,Who will succeed Disney CEO Bob Iger? Investors weigh the options.,"Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger is set to retire in 2026, but the company has yet to announce who will succeed Iger. The CEO has been a big part of the company's recent turnaround, with the company's CFO Hugh Johnston telling Yahoo Finance, ""The magic is back at Disney"" under Iger's leadership. The Wall Street Journal reporter Robbie Whelan sits down with Market Domination Overtime Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to share what he's learned reporting on Iger's approaching succession. Johnston reported that Disney is considering external candidates for the soon-to-be-open CEO role, including Andrew Wilson, the EA CEO. ""Wilson has a pretty, pretty long-standing relationship with the company. He's known Bob Iger for a pretty long time ... The first major kind of encounter between the two, the two men and the two companies, was in 2018 when Andrew Wilson interviewed for the job of head of ESPN, a job that eventually went to Jimmy Pitaro, who is also in the mix as a potential CEO succession candidate."" Iger has reportedly checked in with Ted Sarandos, a co-CEO at Netflix (NFLX) to ask how the two-person CEO structure has worked out for the streaming giant. Johnston says, ""The two names that everyone has in mind when it comes to a potential co-CEO arrangement at Disney are Dana Walden, the co-chair of their entertainment division, and Josh D'Amaro, the chairman of the experiences division."" The reporter notes, ""It's unclear if that same structure would really work at Disney the way it has so well at Netflix.""

""The magic is back at Disney,"" the company's CFO Hugh Johnston tells Yahoo Finance. Tigress Financial Partners CIO Ivan Feinseth joins The Morning Brief to discuss these earnings results. ""It was a great quarter. I think they're definitely turning a corner. I continue to say that content is king, and Disney is the king of content. And the power of their content goes beyond just streaming or even theaters. It goes into the parks. It goes to licensing [and] product sales. So they get multiple bites at the apple for all of the content that they produce. They're just great at telling stories and making great content that resonates across all demographics and endures,"" Feinseth says. ""The profit in streaming is just really a powerful statement,"" the strategist adds, noting that he expects streaming gains to offset linear losses. ""I believe we will continue to see the growth in streaming. They have multiple platforms addressing multiple audiences. I mean, live sports is also a powerful driver of viewership. They have both the fully paid-for subscription model and an advertising paid subscription model, which they're expanding. [There are] more and more companies [that] want to advertise on platforms [where] they can better target the audience and get a better response and measure of the return on their invested advertising dollar. And Disney helps with that."" With Disney CEO Bob Iger set to retire in 2026, investors wait for the company to announce his successor. Feinseth says, ""Iger has been an incredible CEO. He came back, and he's doing an incredible job. And one of the things I believe a good CEO does is to build an enterprise that endures, and whoever takes over will continue to build on the success that he has built.""

Box Office Guru founder and editor Gitesh Pandya joins Catalysts Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss the films' success and what it means for related companies, as well as upcoming releases. ""This is what the box office needed this year. The movie industry, over the last few years, has had two major disruptions. You had the pandemic shutting all theaters down, and then as things are getting back to normal, you have the double strikes,"" Pandya says, adding, ""This year, in 2024, we had many months with hardly any big blockbuster films. But now, as we enter the fourth quarter and going into 2025, the outlook is very good. For Thanksgiving, we have two massive films opening this past weekend, which will continue into the rest of the month."" While not quite as successful as ""Barenheimer,"" Pandya says, ""'Wicked' did fantastic. 'Gladiator II' did really well. The reviews are good, the audience metrics are fantastic, and people are coming out and spending, and that leads into the rest of the holiday season. People are seeing trailers, posters, all of the in-theater product to hopefully come back for the rest of the year to end off 2024 with a bang."" With Disney's (DIS) highly anticipated 'Moana 2' coming out this week, Pandya notes that the sequel, which he says is a ""guaranteed hit,"" combined with the second weekends of Gladiator II and Wicked, ""We're looking at probably the biggest Thanksgiving box office in over a decade.""

Will the fighting league continue to partner with ESPN? In this weekôs episode of Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano is joined by combat sports journalist and host of The Ariel Helwani Show, Ariel Helwani, to discuss the world of MMA, specifically the future of media rights for the league. With streamers expanding their foray into more live sporting events, is it possible the fighting league could branch out to different platforms? I think they remain with ESPN to a certain degree,ù Helwani tells Pompliano. I think that ESPN recognizes that in many respects, the UFC built ESPN+ for them, and they don't wanna let that go. So I think that they will try to keep them at least on pay-per-view exclusively.ù While UFC has historically been linked to one broadcast partner, he points out that fellow TKO Group (TKO) business WWE has branched out and built deals that designated certain fights to certain platforms. All to say that the business of combat sports is booming right now. It's a fascinating time to be covering MMA boxing and or pro wrestling,ù Helwani says.

Wedbush equity research managing director Michael Pachter joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss what it means for the company's live TV offerings. Patcher compares the Disney-Fubo deal with T-Mobile (TMUS) merging with Sprint to become ""a very strong number three,"" adding, ""Hulu and Disney are very powerful, and I think there's a great combination."" The addition of Fubo to Disney's live TV options bolsters the company's position to compete with YouTube, owned by Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). ""I'm really encouraged that the Fubo guys are in charge of this combined enterprise. They have had to kind of survive in an environment where they were outgunned, outmanned, out capitalized, and now they're getting a big balance sheet behind them.""
