20/09/2024,00:00:00,PEP,Great investing debate: Growth or value stocks post-rate cuts?,"It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. ""What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,"" he says, ""and in many cases, that can be growth stocks."" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. ""I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks."" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring ""good old fashioned names"" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. ""It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,"" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,PEP,Inside Brian Cornell's plan to get Target back on track,"Brian Cornell became the first external CEO hire in the history of Target (TGT) when he took the top job in 2014. Ten years in, Cornell has reinvented the company in many ways, experiencing the highs and lows of competing against other major retail giants like Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST). To get an inside look at the veteran CEO’s journey and his plans for the future, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sat down with Cornell at a Target store in Jersey City, NJ. The two also met at a park that played a major role in Cornell’s upbringing in Queens, NY to explore what shaped him into the leader he is today. “If you grow up the way I did, you always feel like the underdog,” says Cornell. This mindset helped Cornell rise the retail ranks. He has served in executive roles at major companies like Safeway and Sam’s Club before running Target. Cornell took over when the retailer was struggling and coming off of a data breach. The CEO’s first big move was to exit Canada, after the company’s $5.4 billion venture north of the border failed to take off. In 2017 Cornell announced the $550 million acquisition of delivery company Shipt and a $7 billion investment in Target stores, at a time when the industry appeared to be shifting away from brick-and-mortar. These decisions paid off during the pandemic, when Target’s revenue shot up past $100 billion for the first time in 2021. Recently, Target has missed the mark compared to competitors, with comparable sales falling for four straight quarters through the first quarter of 2024. Target’s declining numbers were due to a number of factors, including retail theft, a backlash to Pride merchandise in 2023, and excess inventory resulting in price cuts, with the main driver being a slowdown in discretionary spending by consumers. Nearly 50% of Target’s product portfolio is made up of non-essentials—much higher than many competitors. To drive growth into the future, Cornell and Target are mixing strategies old and new. The company plans to invest in 300 stores over the next decade, continuing a trend under Cornell. In April of 2024 Target announced a paid membership program, Target Circle 360, to compete with Amazon Prime and Walmart+. The most recent numbers showed positive signs for the retailer, with sales up 2.7% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024. Target is set to report third quarter earnings on November 20, where the company expects to see more growth, albeit at a slower rate.

Spillane highlights changing consumer behavior as a factor affecting PepsiCo's results.

09/10/2024,00:00:00,PEP,PepsiCo is considering consumer value amid shrinkflation: Analyst,"PepsiCo (PEP) released mixed third quarter results, missing on revenue ($23.32 billion versus estimates of $23.8 billion) and narrowly eeking by earnings estimates (gains of $2.31 per share versus expectations of $2.30). The soft drink and snack giant revised its 2024 full-year sales outlook following lagging North American and international sales. ""The weakness was really in the North America business, both in the snacking and the Quaker food business. And then a little bit of softening [in] some international markets like China, Middle East, even Latin America. Also, Pepsi lowered their full year guidance on organic sales,"" Citi US beverages, household products, and personal care lead analyst Filippo Falorni tells Yahoo Finance. Falorni describes the consumer pullback behavior that Pepsi and other household brands, like Coca-Cola (KO), are seeing. ""I know there's a lot more political attention to shrinkflation. I know Congress is clearly making it a focus to push back on these companies, to give value back to the consumer. And Pepsi talked about it today on the earnings call,"" Falorni says. ""So Pepsi today talked about giving more value in the form of larger pack or for example, bigger multi-packs with more smaller packs within the multipack as a way of again giving back value to the consumer after significant price increases over the last three years."" In an interview with Yahoo Finance earlier today, Bank of America Securities senior consumer goods analyst Bryan Spillane characterized Pepsi as pushing its position ""too far"" amid so-called snackflation trends, which could lead the brand into an adjustment period.
