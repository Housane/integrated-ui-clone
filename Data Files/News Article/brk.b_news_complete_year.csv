Loop Capital Markets managing director Anthony Chukumba joins Market Domination to discuss the move and break down the bull case for the beauty retailer. Chukumba explains that ""to some extent, Warren Buffett's almost like the original value investor."" Thus, that's likely the approach Berkshire Hathaway took when deciding to invest in Ulta. He notes that the stock has had a ""pretty significant"" sell-off this year largely due to concerns about a slowdown in sales as competitors like Sephora and Amazon (AMZN) gain more market share. Loop Capital currently has a Buy rating on Ulta and a $520 price target, and Chukumba adds, ""We do like the fact that Berkshire got involved with the stock. It definitely lends credibility to the story."" He calls the concerns about the company ""overblown,"" and outlines his bull case on the company: ""They have both the mass or the lower end, and prestige or the higher end products. They have a great customer loyalty program. They have a completely debt free balance sheet. They generate a ton of free cash flow. They buy back stock pretty aggressively. I think they're going to initiate a dividend later this year, which will open up the stock to income investors as well.""

29/08/2024,00:00:00,BRK.B,Berkshire Hathaway cut Apple stake to have 'margin of safety',"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) trimmed its stake in Apple (AAPL) by over 50% at the beginning of August. Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and Scharf Investments managing director Eric Lynch joins Market Domination to discuss the move and what the firm may do with the cash. Lynch explains that consumers and investors shouldn't be concerned about the move. Rather, he sees it as a testament to Buffett's commitment to having a margin of safety: ""Look, it's a great company, but he bought it in 2016 at 10 times earnings. He's cut it over half when it's been trading above 30 times earnings. It hasn't moved its sales and its operating income level on the aggregate in almost three years, so he's worried about the margin of safety there."" He adds that with this new cash flow, Buffett is ""finding places to play,"" but ultimately is ""waiting for better valuation."" Lynch notes that Berkshire recently bought Chubb (CB), an insurance company, explaining that insurance premiums are increasing about 10% yearly. In addition, Buffett has identified several lucrative opportunities in Japan. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Berkshire Hathaway shareholder and Scharf Investments managing director Eric Lynch joins Market Domination to discuss the achievement and why he prefers the firm over traditional banks. ""This is a fantastic play on higher-for-longer interest rates. We're all talking about some coming cuts, but there still are a lot higher than they've been in the last two decades. If you look at what's happened with Berkshire, there's a lot of focus on the investment portfolio, but the majority of this business is now an operating company and an insurance company under that. And their investment income is skyrocketing with these higher rates,"" Lynch tells Yahoo Finance. Lynch finds traditional banks to be ""good until they're not."" As interest rates come down, banks will likely expand their net interest markets. Meanwhile, companies like Berkshire Hathaway are more resistant to economic shifts and pullbacks. ""Warren is still kind of a contrarian in a world where... investment flows are really crowding into tech and fixed income. Buffett is speaking with his portfolio, and he's got $272 billion in cash and T-bills... He's well-positioned to take advantage of any dislocation,"" Lynch says.

10/10/2024,00:00:00,BRK.B,There's 'hidden value' in Wells Fargo: Portfolio manager,"As big banks are set to report their third quarter earnings, Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Macrae Sykes joins Catalysts to discuss his top picks in the sector. Sykes points to Wells Fargo (WFC) as one of his top holdings, explaining that the bank has underperformed since it became subject to an asset cap in 2018. However, the bank is reportedly in the final phase of getting its asset cap lifted, which would be very bullish for the stock. In addition, Sykes believes that investors appreciate Wells Fargo's growth path ahead, noting that there's ""hidden value"" in the company. Sykes adds that Citizens Financial Group (CFG) is in a solid position after acquiring Silicon Valley, despite facing some NII (net interest income) headwinds next year. When it comes to regional banks in general, he expects these companies to be ""better positioned and normalized."" He explains, ""The CRA (Community Reinvestment Act) to some extent has stabilized a little bit. Real estate is doing a little bit better. So I think that helps them. They're more sensitive certainly to NII than, say, the bigger banks, which have more contribution from other segments as well."" Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) offloaded nearly $10 million worth of Bank of America (BAC) shares, and Sykes says, ""Obviously, when the biggest shareholder and one of the world's foremost investors is selling, clearly it gives you pause."" He explains that Berkshire likely decided to manage its portfolio risk. However, he sees ""pretty good trends"" ahead for the bank.

01/11/2024,00:00:00,BRK.B,Inside $1 billion Nike rival Brooks,"Brooks Running may not be nearly as large as Nike (NKE) or New Balance, but that doesn’t mean its impact on the sneaker industry isn’t still strong. The company – founded in the early 1900s to sell ballet slippers and bathing shoes – continues to be the top sneaker choice for serious runners. To maintain its pole position in running, Brooks has released a host of new innovations, such as the Glycerin Max Road Shoe for a pricey $200. But fending off upstarts such as On (ONON) and to a lesser extent, Decker’s Outdoor (DECK) owned Hoka won’t be easy. A resurgence at struggling Nike under new CEO Elliott Hill may also pose a risk. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi sits down with new Brooks Running CEO Dan Sheridan inside the Nasdaq Marketsite in Times Square ahead of the New York City Marathon. Sheridan reveals his vision for Brooks Running a few months into the top job and what Nike’s many stumbles have meant to the company’s growth. The long-time Brooks executive also shares what it’s like to be owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A).
