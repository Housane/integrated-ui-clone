18/07/2024,00:00:00,JNJ,"Small caps, biggest themes in the media landscape: Catalysts","On today's episode of Catalysts, hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down major market trends from the rise of small-cap stocks to the mergers and acquisitions activity within the media industry. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) has risen by more than 10% in the last five trading sessions, marking the longest streak of gains for the small-cap index since April 2020. MAI Capital Management chief equity strategist Chris Grisanti believes that small caps are still ""underpriced"" despite the Russell 2000 having ""its biggest move in terms of standard deviations that we've seen in more than 30 years over the last week."" He adds that small-cap stocks are cheap buying opportunities: ""I don't think it's too late to initiate positions if you haven't already."" Retail stocks are on the move as shares of Five Below (FIVE) sink nearly 20% after the retailer announced its CEO Joel Anderson is resigning. The retailer also lowered its second quarter guidance. Meanwhile, shares of Vans parent company VF Corporation (VFC) are jumping on reports that the apparel company will be selling its Supreme brand to European eyewear brand EssilorLuxottica (EL.PA, ESLOY) for $1.5 billion. Paramount Global's (PARA, PARAA) plans to merge with Skydance Media have left investors pondering whether more M&A deals could be in the media landscape's future. As part of this week's Media, Streaming, & Investing: What's Next special, Market Domination host Josh Lipton breaks down analysts' forecasts for mergers and acquisitions in the media industry and the potential headwinds media companies face as the 2024 presidential election nears. LightShed Partners partner and media & technology analyst Rich Greenfield believes that ""no major M&A would happen this year, and I think that's what played out,"" believing media M&A deals such as Paramount's merger with Skydance will be finalized in 2025 due to regulatory concerns.

18/07/2024,00:00:00,JNJ,"Chip stocks under pressure, pharmaceuticals rise: Morning Brief","On today's episode of Morning Brief, hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down the market open and some of the biggest stories hitting the market. The major market averages (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are under pressure Wednesday morning, with the Nasdaq Composite falling by over 300 points  or over 1.6%  as semiconductor stocks drag down the tech-heavy indexes. As a new report from Bloomberg outlines the Biden administration's plans for stricter trade regulations on chip exports to China, Principal Asset Management chief global strategist Seema Shah explains: ""In a way, this is not unexpected. I think everyone has been anticipating that,as you see this continuation of US-China tensions, that, unfortunately, some of these chip makers, technology almost falls right into the spotlight."" However, InsingerGilissen senior analyst Jos Versteeg believes ASML (ASML) will continue to perform well despite the news, saying, ""When you look at China, China semiconductor manufacturing, they are using mainly low-end chips and the US wants them to keep on producing low-end chips because the world needs it."" Meanwhile, the US political landscape is heating up. In a recent Bloomberg interview, former President Donald Trump said he would allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to complete his term if reelected, as long as Trump thinks Powell is ""doing the right thing."" However, Trump doesn't think the Fed should cut rates before the election in November because that could help President Biden's reelection prospects. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who recently backed Trump in the 2024 election, announced on X, formerly Twitter, that he plans to relocate the headquarters of both SpaceX and X to Austin, Texas. This move is in response to a new California law regarding transgender rights in schools, bringing increased rhetoric to some of the biggest issues dominating the November election. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) posted its second quarter earnings Wednesday morning, beating estimates on its top and bottom lines. However, the pharmaceutical giant slashed its full-year profit forecast. Shares of Roche (ROG.SW) are also moving higher on Wednesday as the company reported positive results from its obesity drug trial for a once-a-day oral pill currently labeled CT-996.

Johnson & Johnson reports earnings on Tuesday, which Shibutani says typically kicks off earnings season for healthcare, but also for the large-cap pharmas. It really is the beachhead many read across sort of resultù given the companys pharmaceuticals and medical device businesses. Shibutani says hes watching closely the strategic moves that the company has been making in medtech.ù The analyst holds a Neutral rating on the stock, but says it will be interesting to see how they manage through this period of exposure to biosimilarsù which could be a potential upside for the company, as well as balancing pursuing patents for what we call small molecules, pills and tabletsù as well as injectables. The analyst shares his perspective on Pfizer as investors access the companys role in the post-pandemic market. When you look at stock performance for Pfizer, it naturally peaked several years back at the height of the pandemic, where the contributions the company made to address the Covid pandemic with the vaccine and the therapeutic Paxlovid were certainly tremendous. The stock, however, has had very challenging relative underperformance over the last few years, and the strategies that the company has been invoking, whether it's through M&A, have generated some mixed results.ù Shibutani says activist investor activity would be unsurprising given where you see the relative underperformance for the stock,ù especially as attention to some of [the recent] issues does heighten the level of urgency, and that's probably not a bad thing anytime the company is trying to address some of the challenges.ù To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination here.

Mizuho healthcare equity strategist Jared Holz joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on the healthcare sector for this earnings season. Holz identifies three key factors impacting healthcare earnings: healthcare utilization, the upcoming US presidential election, and Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) activity. According to Holz, healthcare utilization is ""the driving factor"" for companies reporting earnings. Based on reports so far, he notes that the procedural earnings backdrop remains strong, ""indicating a lot more patient mobility,"" surgeries, and other activities, which bodes well for the overall healthcare sector. ""We kind of look at the sector in its entirety; it's really based so much on what patients are doing, what sort of procedures they're having, and we're finding that they're running still very strong,"" Holz explains. While Holz acknowledges that the presidential election will have a short-term impact on the healthcare sector, he points out that investors are closely watching the outcome. He notes that Medicare rates are typically more favorable under Republican leadership than Democratic leadership. ""If that winds up being the case,"" he suggests, healthcare stocks could see a rebound. However, Holz doesn't anticipate significant long-term changes in the sector due to election results. Regarding M&A activity, Holz observes, ""All of the pharma companies are subject to the same macro challenges across the board, which is to say that these assets in the pharmaceutical industry are not durable, and they have to continuously do M&A to keep revenue growth going and earnings growth going.""
