16/10/2024,00:00:00,UNH,This is the 3-point checklist for healthcare earnings: Strategist,"Major healthcare companies, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH), reported their third quarter earnings on Tuesday morning. Mizuho healthcare equity strategist Jared Holz joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on the healthcare sector for this earnings season. Holz identifies three key factors impacting healthcare earnings: healthcare utilization, the upcoming US presidential election, and Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) activity. According to Holz, healthcare utilization is ""the driving factor"" for companies reporting earnings. Based on reports so far, he notes that the procedural earnings backdrop remains strong, ""indicating a lot more patient mobility,"" surgeries, and other activities, which bodes well for the overall healthcare sector. ""We kind of look at the sector in its entirety; it's really based so much on what patients are doing, what sort of procedures they're having, and we're finding that they're running still very strong,"" Holz explains. While Holz acknowledges that the presidential election will have a short-term impact on the healthcare sector, he points out that investors are closely watching the outcome. He notes that Medicare rates are typically more favorable under Republican leadership than Democratic leadership. ""If that winds up being the case,"" he suggests, healthcare stocks could see a rebound. However, Holz doesn't anticipate significant long-term changes in the sector due to election results. Regarding M&A activity, Holz observes, ""All of the pharma companies are subject to the same macro challenges across the board, which is to say that these assets in the pharmaceutical industry are not durable, and they have to continuously do M&A to keep revenue growth going and earnings growth going.""

While the stock is currently under scrutiny as the only Magnificent Seven stock declining since November 1, Woods maintains that Nvidia remains fundamentally strong.

""The move is just a garden variety sell-off, but the amount of stocks that are down is a little head-scratching,"" he states.

24/12/2024,00:00:00,UNH,Healthcare concerns rise as insurers deny patient claims,"Health insurance claim denials continue to be a significant challenge in the US healthcare system. When insurers reject claims, doctors and hospitals face delays in reimbursement for their services, often leading them to postpone patient care until procedures or treatments receive proper authorization. Recent Medicare data reveals that the industry average for denied claims has reached 17%, with UnitedHealthcare (UNH) showing the highest denial rate at 33%. Yahoo Finance Senior Health Reporter Anjalee Khemlani examines this issue, highlighting automation and artificial intelligence as one of the driving forces behind high denial rates. She discusses implications for healthcare providers and patients, and shares three tips to fight claim denials: 1) never pay the first bill, 2) fight with insurer for coverage, and 3) ask for cash pay options.  To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealth here.

The suspected gunman, Luigi Mangione, has been charged with several counts of murder and even terrorism, which he pleaded not guilty to on Monday. In the aftermath of this event, Americans have expressed an outcry over their frustrations with dealing with health insurance providers and maneuvering the cracks in the US healthcare system. Center for Health and Democracy (CHD) President Wendell Potter joins Market Domination's Josh Lipton and Yahoo Finance senior health reporter Anjalee Khemlani to speak more about his self-described ""crisis of conscience"" when he worked within the health industry. Potter penned a New York Times op-ed piece last week titled I Was a Health Insurance Executive. What I Saw Made Me Quit. ""I became aware of the barriers that health insurance companies have put in place to assure their profitability, but that have resulted in more and more Americans not being able to get the care that they need, medically necessary care, even with insurance,"" the former Cigna (CI) vice president of communications explains. ""Those barriers that that they put in place to assure profitability and shareholder return really made me walk away. I used to handle financial communications for Cigna, my name was on all of the company's quarterly reports for ten years. So I saw how the company made money, where it came from, what they did with it, but also the way that they were able to earn the profits...""
