31/07/2024,00:00:00,MRK,Why this analyst is 'extremely bullish' on biopharma,"Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) reported their second quarter earnings, with both companies beating expectations. Grey Ghost Advisors CEO Meghan Fitzgerald joins Catalysts to give insight into Pfizer and Merck's recent earnings and what the reports signal about the broader healthcare sector. Fitzgerald begins by explaining why she is ""extremely bullish"" on biopharma: ""There's been $1 billion in deals this year so far. The majority of big pharma trade below the S&P 500 forward 2025 multiple of 20. For example, BMS is less than eight times. So what we're seeing is investors want to take risk, but they're expecting outsized returns. I also think regardless of the election, the market is poised to perform well because of the baseline fundamentals, the science."" ""Speaking directly to Pfizer, I think Pfizer's equity value has fallen 50% since its 2021 peak today, and their story gave them a chance to highlight a strategy past Covid, which they deserve a lot of credit for. And I think they did a good job telling the story this morning,"" Fitzgerald tells Yahoo Finance.
