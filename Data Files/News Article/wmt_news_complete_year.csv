American Giant founder and CEO Bayard Winthrop joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the partnership and some of the core principles behind the brand. ""It was a real breakthrough moment for our brand, and for textiles more broadly, when you have a partner like Walmart stepping up to a long-term commitment and a volume commitment that allows the supply chain partners to really rethink the way they're thinking about producing apparel in the United States again,"" Winthrop says. While textiles cost more to produce in the US, he believes the benefits are worth it: ""When you make things here, you do it within the constraints of the American system, which includes human rights protections, environmental protections, child labor protections, living wages, things that I think we all as Americans really appreciate."" Winthrop stresses the importance of investing in America's manufacturing capabilities and workforce, explaining, ""We begin to give good opportunities to those towns, those cities that want to have good, viable, and dignified work. And so that was a real founding mission for our brand."" He notes that American Giant fulfills the need of consumers looking for access to good-quality, American-made products at reasonable prices. He adds, ""I think the larger brands and retailers have, as a generalized statement, tried to be a part of the solution here. And I think this now points a way forward for them to join the conversation.""

Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry joins Wealth! to break down the movement and how investors can best navigate the sell-off. ""The market's been a little bit overdue for a pullback like this,"" Mulberry argues. Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities, highlighting names like Walmart (WMT) and Coca-Cola (KO) since ""being concentrated on quality is how you're going to survive this particular sell down in the market."" As major tech stocks have dipped amid the global market sell-off, Mulberry believes that the companies actually monetizing AI will be in a better standing among competitors. ""The dividing line is going to be, 'what is your business model?' There's been an enormous amount of investment from all of those companies in this type of technology. But who's actually closing the loop and generating revenue from AI?"" he explains. He points to Microsoft (MSFT) as one of those names as it generates revenue from its subscription service that allows users to access ChatGPT through the Microsoft Office suite.

06/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,"How the market sell-off may impact retirement, rate cuts: Wealth!","On today's episode of Wealth!, Host Brad Smith breaks down some of the biggest stories impacting your personal finances, from the global market sell-off to an interest rate cut in September from the Federal Reserve. The major indexes (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are slipping as recession fears trigger a widespread sell-off among investors. However, Fort Washington Investment Advisors co-chief investment officer Chris Shipley believes the current downturn shouldn't cause investor panic. He notes the market had ""a certain vulnerability"" due to expectations of economic growth and lower inflation. Yet, there turned out to be ""a little more economic weakness than the market was banking on,"" indicating the economy is entering ""a more substantial slowdown."" He views the current situation as an ideal buying opportunity, pointing to companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which hasn't seen low share prices since March or April, noting: ""When stocks are on sale, it's time to start taking a look."" Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry argues that the market has been ""a little bit overdue for a pullback like this."" Amid the sell-off, he encourages investors to focus on companies with high-quality balance sheets, multiple revenue streams, low levels of debt, and good cash flow metrics. He points to consumer staples (XLP) as good investment opportunities. Some investors are concerned about the pullback's effects on their long-term retirement investments. Vanguard senior wealth advisor Cassandra Rupp, CFP, says, ""We can only control what we can control,"" and breaks down some of the biggest mistakes when managing 401(k) plans: ""Everyone's time horizon can be different. I mean, if we're speaking to some of this reporting in 401(k)'s for retirement savings, depends on what stage of your career you're at. We're seeing an increase in participant deferral rates above 4% now. So we're seeing more and more individuals start to automatically save out of their paychecks into these types of plans."" Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Kerry Hannon adds that if you're investing in a retirement account, you will experience periods where you're buying high and periods where you're buying low. In the end, it'll most likely even out. In response to recent signs of economic weakness, Wall Street is convinced the Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut rates by 50 basis points at their September meeting. However, with investors believing the Fed may be delayed in rate reductions, speculation is growing about a potential cut even sooner. Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Jennifer Schonberger breaks down the details, discussing how the Fed can implement rate cuts outside of their scheduled meetings and historical trends that prompted emergency rate cuts.

16/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,"Jobless claims, retail sales, Walmart earnings: Morning Brief","On today's episode of Morning Brief, Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market open and cover some of the biggest stories of the trading day. Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) charged ahead at the market open, riding high on July's retail sales data and the most recent jobless claims print. Initial jobless claims for the week ending in August 10 ticked lower to 227,000, coming in below the estimated 235,000. This is the second week of declines for jobless claims, indicating a continued strength in the labor market. Meanwhile, July's retail sales rose 1%, soaring past estimates of a 0.4% increase. This comes as inflation continues to moderate, and signals overall resiliency in consumer spending. As Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief, BMO Wealth Management US chief investment officer Yung-Yu Ma explains that there's a ""very strong confluence of data now, along with Fed comments that they're ready to cut rates and stand ready to respond to labor market softness."" Therefore, he argues that ""the soft landing is firmly in place,"" and the stage has been set for growth acceleration into early 2025. Walmart's (WMT) second quarter earnings also spoke to the consumer resiliency highlighted in July's retail sales data. The company beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines and raised its full-year sales and profit guidance. Walmart Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey says the consumer has remained consistent and is ""hanging in there"" despite uncertainty surrounding the election and geopolitical events. Shares of Cisco Systems (CSCO) are climbing in the stock's biggest intraday gain since March of 2020. The company topped its fiscal fourth quarter earnings expectations and announced a 7% cut in its workforce as it shifts priorities. Cisco CFO Scott Herren notes that the AI, cybersecurity, cloud, and networking areas of the business are seeing the fastest growth, which Cisco is investing heavily into. As the company evolves, he sees security and networking becoming increasingly intertwined businesses as customers seek secure networks. Brinker International (EAT), the parent company of restaurant chains Chili's and Maggiano's Little Italy, saw comparable sales jump 13.5% year-over-year, as reported in its fiscal fourth quarter earnings. The company attributes this feat to higher restaurant traffic and its increase in menu prices. Brinker International CEO and President Kevin Hochman explains: ""We know things are tough out there, but we have this industry-leading value. And we've spent a lot of time in the last two years and a lot of investments on improving the experience. So that means making sure we have more labor in the restaurants, we've reduced our menu by over 22%, and we put also investments into facilities.""

16/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Walmart's Q2 paints different picture of consumers: Analyst,"Walmart (WMT) released its second quarter earnings, inching past top and bottom line estimates. The retail giant also raised its full-year sales and profit guidance after seeing strength in the consumer. As many consumers have felt the pressure of inflation, with some retailers and financial analysts claiming there has been a more discerning consumer, why has Walmart seen this level of success versus some other retailers? Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali joins Wealth! to give insight into the strength of the consumer and what it means for the broader market moving forward. ""I don't think that I'm as optimistic about the future of the retail economy and the consumer attitudes as maybe the market seems to suggest. And the reason for that is that what I'm looking at is how is growth relative to inflation, and what we've seen over the last several months, and definitely the most recent retail data from the [US Census Bureau] suggested the same,"" says Kodali, ""which is that consumer spending is essentially in line and in some categories below the rates of inflation. So that means that even though the numbers may be positive, the consumer is really, really softening."" She follows that up, claiming Walmart's numbers are coming from lower-income consumers taking on more debt: ""They are the most stretched, and they are likely driving some of these strong Walmart numbers, because even though Walmart is growing, a lot of other retailers are not. So Walmart's growth, I would argue, is probably coming at the expense of other retailers that consumers may have been spending money with during the pandemic.""

Baker notes that he is ""not surprised"" by Walmart's strong performance, noting their results ""look better than most retailers."" He points out that Walmart is ""taking a lot of market share"" and that ""their trends are better than the overall consumer environment."" In contrast, Baker suggests that competitors like Target (TGT) face lower expectations and are unlikely to match Walmart's earnings results. ""In this environment where the consumer, we think, is still very strapped, the focus is on value and consumables more than discretionary goods. And so that does favor retailers like Walmart,"" Baker tells Yahoo Finance. Baker emphasizes that Walmart's success goes beyond just offering value. He highlights the company's investments in convenience, improved product mix, and store upgrades, stating that ""all those things are helping them not only win market share but keep that market share.""

17/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,"H&R Block tops Q4 earnings, Harris unveils housing plans: Wealth!","On today's episode of Wealth!, Host Brad Smith breaks down key stories impacting your personal finances, from the risk of a recession to new housing propositions from the Harris administration. Stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are recovering as markets look to the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in September amid signs of cooling inflation. Allspring Global Investments senior portfolio manager and head of global liquidity solutions Jeff Weaver highlights July's CPI data, calling it ""good for the Fed,"" as well as markets and consumers. He notes the economy remains ""strong,"" with interest rates coming down incrementally, ""and that's what's driving a lot of flows."" One risk Weaver points out is a rise in the unemployment rate. August's consumer sentiment data topped economist estimates, as reported by the University of Michigan, showing an increase for the first time in five months. This positive trend aligns with strong retail sales figures for July and robust earnings reports from retail giants like Walmart (WMT), all suggesting continued consumer resiliency. Yahoo Finance anchor Julie Hyman delves into the details, analyzing what all this data reveals about the current state of the consumer. H&R Block (HRB) shares are trading higher following the company's fourth-quarter earnings beat on both top and bottom lines, driven by its artificial intelligence initiatives. H&R Block CEO Jeff Jones emphasizes that while the company is ""known for consumer tax preparation,"" they're diversifying into areas such as small business services and mobile banking. Mortgage rates ticked higher this week, however, they have been trending downward over the last year. William Raveis Mortgage regional vice president Melissa Cohn elaborates on what it will take to get people back to the housing market in droves: ""If we want to see the floodgates open, I would say that the rate has to go down to 5.5%. But the fact that we're down to 6.5% or just below that, or if you think about it, we were not too long ago hovering in the mid-sevens. I think that every quarter percent cut in interest rates will sort of bring that next level or next group of buyers back into the marketplace."" Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign has outlined some big plans for revitalizing the housing industry, from the construction of 3 million new homes over the next four years to tax incentives for builders who construct starter homes. Author of Your Money Playbook and former NFL player Brandon Copeland notes that one of the biggest fears young people have today is whether they will ever be able to afford the home of their dreams.

19/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Consumer still weak despite July's retail sales: Analyst,"Stronger-than-expected retail sales, along with earnings reports from retail giants like Walmart (WMT), have suggested a more robust American consumer. But is this really the case? Are consumers genuinely regaining their strength? D.A. Davidson senior analyst Michael Baker and Retail Cities managing director Bryan Gildenberg joins Morning Brief to share their perspectives on the consumer outlook. Baker believes the consumer is slowing down, forecasting that ""most retailers will guide down for the back half"" of 2024. However, he points out that Walmart is ""one big exception,"" emphasizing that its performance reflects its continued ability to take market share, ""not necessarily the strength of the consumer."" ""It's definitely a slowing environment, despite those data points from last week,"" Baker states. Gildenberg highlights inflation in the US, particularly in shelter costs, as a factor contributing to stretched consumer wallets. ""I think it will be interesting to see over time as the Fed [Federal Reserve] lowers interest rates... the impact of that has on liquidity in the housing market, the impact that that has on unplugging the logjam at the top of the rental market, and I think that'll help retailers that are selling to renters that are trying to make ends meet,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.

On one hand, retail giants like Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) have reported earnings that topped expectations, suggesting a strong consumer base that is actively seeking value. However, department stores like Macy's (M) have fallen short of expectations across nearly all fronts, indicating consumer weakness and hesitancy to splurge on discretionary items. Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma analyzes the health of the consumer, shedding light on factors impacting consumer spending.

21/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,"Target, Macy's feel the pinch as consumer spending softens","The pressure on the consumer is shifting to retailers, as earnings from industry giants Target (TGT) and Macy's (M) point to ongoing weakness in the consumer. Target reported better-than-expected second quarter results, topping Wall Street expectations on profit and revenue. The retail powerhouse also saw a 3% increase in store traffic during the quarter. However, Target's full-year guidance remains cautious, reflecting the ongoing consumer spending slowdown. In contrast, Macy's reported net sales of $4.9 billion, falling short of the $5.06 billion estimated. Same-store sales also disappointed, falling 4% where Wall Street had only been expecting a 0.27% drop. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi breaks down the factors that drove Target's results, despite the consumer still being ""choosy."" This includes the company's efforts to lower prices and introduce more discount initiatives, which could position it for strength heading into the holiday season. Meanwhile, Yahoo Finance senior reporter Brooke DiPalma dives into Macy's report, discussing what it revealed about the state of the consumer. She notes that discretionary consumer spending is still feeling squeezed, with even higher-end consumers feeling the pinch and the broader department store landscape continuing to struggle.

""There are two common denominators right now that are jumping out. The first one being that as you mentioned, retailers are all about the omnichannel strategy. And this is what's important in order to attract the consumers to the stores. Home Depot (HD), Walmart, Lowe's (LOW) yesterday all told us, and even Target today they smashed their e-commerce estimate with a robust 8.3% growth in e-commerce. Consumers are are ordering things on their mobile phones and then wanting to pick them up in store on their way from work to home. And so this is really what's driving sales,"" says Martis Martis points out how consumers are really focused on value, ""they are shopping at the discounters, off-price retailers."" She adds ""The trend this year has been like you saw July retail sales... really smashing expectations. And that was because the average promotional rate and the amount of merchandise on sale really spiked to the highest level it did all year round.

22/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,"JD.com, Walmart have 'frenemy relationship': KraneShares CIO","Retail giant Walmart (WMT) has decided to offload all of its shares and end its eight-year partnership with Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com (JD). This move raises questions about the broader implications for China's e-commerce landscape. KraneShares chief investment officer Brendan Ahern joins Market Domination Overtime to analyze this development. Ahern notes that domestic consumption in China has been ""scarred"" by COVID-19 and ""the downdraft in real estate prices,"" which is weighing on China's ""domestic consumption story."" This adversely impacts major e-commerce players like JD, Alibaba (BABA), and Pinduoduo (PDD), as Ahern describes it as ""a tougher space"" overall. Delving deeper into the Walmart-JD partnership, Ahern explains that it had lasted for over eight years. However, he believes Walmart has now established a strong enough footing in China that ""they no longer need a partner."" Ahern suggests the partnership was even ""encroaching on JD's core e-commerce business,"" both online and offline. As a result, he does not interpret this move as Walmart trying to withdraw from China's economy. Instead, Ahern views it as Walmart declaring, ""we have enough bandwidth to go alone,"" characterizing the relationship with JD as a ""frenemy relationship.""

So Walmart is absolutely crushing it with their strong value, low-price message, and Target, who's trying to get that back, they lowered a lot of prices, they're emphasizing that, did better than they've been doing, but still lags a lot.

30/08/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Walmart is a problem for Dollar General: Analyst's big reason why,"Shares of Dollar General (DG) plunged over 30% on Thursday after the company slashed its full-year guidance, with the CEO warning its core consumer is cash strapped. Piper Sandler managing director Peter Keith joins Market Domination to give insight into what's driving Dollar General's stock price. He notes that Walmart (WMT) is a problem for Dollar General, saying that it's a ""giant vacuum cleaner sucking up a lot of market share,"" citing that part of the reason why is Walmart's digital strategy.  Keith elaborates on why Dollar General is performing poorly during the current economic landscape: ""When we're in this a little bit tighter consumer spending environment where normally Dollar General would be picking up market share, seeing what they call trade in or trade down, new customers coming into Dollar General. That's not happening. Those customers are going to Walmart because they like the digital capabilities. And frankly, you know, Dollar General, the dollar store model isn't very digital."" He follows up with how the company could turn it around: ""We do think they need to build out a more robust, digital playbook that if they want to get younger customers, they want to get more middle-income customers. There are certain basic things around digital shopping and e-commerce that are just demanded these days."" Watch the video above to hear what Keith said about Best Buy's (BBY) Q2 results.

03/09/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Strategist warns of 'larger pullback' amid soft landing hopes,"As September begins, many investors are anticipating the Federal Reserve to begin cutting interest rates at its September meeting. However, questions remain around how consumers and markets (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are faring in the current rate environment and whether a soft landing is on the horizon. To give deeper insights into the economy, Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez joins Morning Brief. While the consumer has been portrayed as resilient during this period of economic uncertainty, Fernandez questions whether this is truly the case. Although retailers like Walmart (WMT) are outperforming, suggesting strong consumer spending, Fernandez fears to overlook the fact that Walmart is a budget retailer catering to lower-income consumers. ""Is Walmart doing better because the consumer is out there spending more and excited to spend more, or is Walmart doing better because their base grew, because they had to bring in normally higher-income earners that shop other places are now coming into Walmart?"" she questions. ""I think that's part of the story."" Regarding the possibility of a soft landing, Fernandez states, ""I think there's a lot of uncertainties that we'd get a soft landing. I'm not saying we'd go full-on recession, but I think we could be waiting for a larger pullback.""

But even in a rough market, there can be bright spots.  Despite the volatility, one positive Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney sees is investors broadening out their investments beyond the ""Magnificent Seven"" names.  As a growth manager, Mahoney says he doesn't mind ""some of these companies that are embracing technology to help out their top line and bottom line."" He uses Walmart (WMT) as one example of a company that is using technology to grow its e-commerce business.  Mahoney also likes Apple (AAPL), citing its stock buyback program and the potential AI upgrade cycle for phones and computers.

Sundaram, however, still has the sector as an Underweight, arguing that cyclical sectors are ""best poised for long-term growth"" given the Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon.  With some pockets of consumers slowing their spending, Sundaram thinks there will be winners and losers in the space, telling Yahoo Finance he likes big box retailers such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), Target (TGT), and BJ's (BJ).  Watch the video above to hear what it is about those stocks Sundaram likes.

20/09/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Great investing debate: Growth or value stocks post-rate cuts?,"It's an age-old question among investors: which is better, growth investing or value investing? After the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut this week kicked off a highly-anticipated easing cycle, Catalysts hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills spoke with a panel of experts about how the two investment strategies could play out in the months to come. Vontobel portfolio manager Markus Hansen and Greenwich Wealth's CIO Vahan Janjigian join Catalysts to lay out their investment thesis. Vahan favors value over growth — but says he's not a strict value investor. ""What I really favor is stocks that are undervalued,"" he says, ""and in many cases, that can be growth stocks."" In terms of investments, Vahan notes he's leaning toward traditional value stocks, like IBM (IBM), Verizon (VZ), and Pfizer (PFE). And in the wake of the Fed's latest rate cut, Vahan sees small caps (IWM) as benefitting from changes to the yield curve. ""I think as things normalize, we'll get back to what's considered normal. And that means value stocks outperform growth stocks and small cap stocks outperform large cap stocks."" Markus and his team at Vontobel are quality growth focused. He says post-rate cut, he expects dividends will get a lot of love from investors. That's why he's favoring ""good old fashioned names"" like Coca-Cola (KO), Walmart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), and PepsiCo (PEP) for their sustained dividend growth. Luxury is also a sector he finds compelling for its wide economic moat. ""It requires time to build that heritage, and to be the top brand,"" he says, and that longevity makes companies like Hermes (RMS.PA), Ferrari (RACE), and Richemont (CFR.SW) compelling.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Inside Brian Cornell's plan to get Target back on track,"Brian Cornell became the first external CEO hire in the history of Target (TGT) when he took the top job in 2014. Ten years in, Cornell has reinvented the company in many ways, experiencing the highs and lows of competing against other major retail giants like Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST). To get an inside look at the veteran CEO’s journey and his plans for the future, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sat down with Cornell at a Target store in Jersey City, NJ. The two also met at a park that played a major role in Cornell’s upbringing in Queens, NY to explore what shaped him into the leader he is today. “If you grow up the way I did, you always feel like the underdog,” says Cornell. This mindset helped Cornell rise the retail ranks. He has served in executive roles at major companies like Safeway and Sam’s Club before running Target. Cornell took over when the retailer was struggling and coming off of a data breach. The CEO’s first big move was to exit Canada, after the company’s $5.4 billion venture north of the border failed to take off. In 2017 Cornell announced the $550 million acquisition of delivery company Shipt and a $7 billion investment in Target stores, at a time when the industry appeared to be shifting away from brick-and-mortar. These decisions paid off during the pandemic, when Target’s revenue shot up past $100 billion for the first time in 2021. Recently, Target has missed the mark compared to competitors, with comparable sales falling for four straight quarters through the first quarter of 2024. Target’s declining numbers were due to a number of factors, including retail theft, a backlash to Pride merchandise in 2023, and excess inventory resulting in price cuts, with the main driver being a slowdown in discretionary spending by consumers. Nearly 50% of Target’s product portfolio is made up of non-essentials—much higher than many competitors. To drive growth into the future, Cornell and Target are mixing strategies old and new. The company plans to invest in 300 stores over the next decade, continuing a trend under Cornell. In April of 2024 Target announced a paid membership program, Target Circle 360, to compete with Amazon Prime and Walmart+. The most recent numbers showed positive signs for the retailer, with sales up 2.7% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024. Target is set to report third quarter earnings on November 20, where the company expects to see more growth, albeit at a slower rate.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,WMT,How to play wholesale retailers like Costco and AutoZone,"UBS US hardline and broadline and food retail analyst Michael Lasser joins Market Domination hosts Josh Lipton and Julie Hyman to discuss how to play wholesale retailers with a focus on Costco (COST) and AutoZone (AZO). The analyst says the “number one” thing he’s looking for out of Costco’s upcoming earnings report is “very healthy growth in the membership fee income. That is a critical driver of the company's profit and loss statement. It represents about 50% of its total income. So monitoring that metric is important.” He adds he will also be watching for “how its margins are performing. What we look at is a key metric called core. On core gross margin, which is an indicator of how profitability on a particular item is doing this year compared to the same period last year that had been going up in the more recent quarters. It's been going down a little bit as the company invests to try and continue to offer value to its consumers.” Lasser says “Costco is, without question, taking market share. Costco is taking market share from the vast majority of the players in the market, you know, that includes conventional grocery stores, specialty retail stores, mall-based retailers.” He says consumers are attracted to “the value quality equation” and opportunities to consolidate trips and time spent in stores. “Costco is uniquely well positioned to benefit from both of those trends,” he says.” After Costco’s recent fee hike, Lasser says earnings will offer a look into retention, which he expects to remain strong “even if it does ease off ever so slightly,” and “how is [the company] using this additional pool of profits that it's going to be able to accrue to increase the value proposition to its consumers.” AutoZone recently reported its fourth quarter earnings results missing expectations, but the stock is still up double-digits year-to-date. Lasser says, “The reason why the stock is up like it is is because the market is gravitating to sustainable growth stories. If we're sitting here a year from now, there's a lot of uncertainty over the next 12 months. We could walk through those factors. But what the market is saying is that it has a higher degree of confidence that AutoZone will continue to grow its earnings in light of how it's positioned and in light of the market that it serves. More so than other retailers.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Target CEO is fighting back against retail theft and winning,"Target (TGT) CEO Brian Cornell took the retailer’s top job in 2014, at a time when the business was struggling and coming off of a large data breach. Over the majority of Cornell’s tenure, Target has held its own against rivals Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT). Cornell led the company to a revenue increase of nearly 50% from 2015 to 2022, peaking at over $109B as part of a pandemic-related spending surge. Since that peak, Target sales and profits have dipped due to a decline in discretionary spending among consumers, and other factors, including retail theft. In 2022 alone, inventory shrinkage, mostly in the form of retail theft, shaved off $700M from the company’s profits. Following a wave of high-profile ‘smash and grabs,’ including several at Target stores, Target and other retailers have leaned in to increased security and technology to not only reduce and deter theft but to make stores safer and more accessible for customers. These efforts, along with government involvement, are already having an impact, according to Cornell. “I feel so much better today than I did a year ago, and I think it comes back to support at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level,” Cornell says. “To be clear, we do not like locking up product, but we like running stores and we want to keep our stores open. We want to make sure they're safe.” For more of the full conversation with Cornell, tune into Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 10:30 a.m. ET.

He notes that Walmart has only been able to compete on value over the last decade, saying, ""They had the same 5,000ish stores, and they were as convenient as they ever were going to be."" However, the COVID pandemic ended up being a catalyst for Walmart as many consumers turned to online shopping. ""That allows Walmart to compete with new customers for the first time that are still out of the range of those 5,000 stores. So they're now able to offer a convenience element that wasn't available to them on top of being one of the most valued positioned retailers,"" he tells Yahoo Finance.

As the third quarter earnings season kicks off, Keith Buchanan, GLOBALT Investments senior portfolio manager, breaks down what investors can expect. ""The expectations for earnings have started to accelerate from mid-single digits to next year to mid-double digits. And coming into this fourth quarter is a real transition quarter from that lower healthy growth to robust growth,"" he tells Yahoo Finance. Thus, he expects areas like financials (XLF), industrials (XLI), and consumer discretionary (XLY) to be poised for growth heading into 2025, explaining, ""Those valuations are miles away from where they traditionally trade on a relative to the broader S&P 500 (^GSPC).""

A Missouri federal judge placed an injunction on President Biden's SAVE student loan forgiveness plan, which features a clause to eliminate 100% of remaining interest for loan borrowers. As the plan sits in legal purgatory, Edvisors director of corporate communications Elaine Rubin breaks down the Biden administration's biggest hurdles in pushing forward its student loan forgiveness agenda. ""So in this election year, we know that the Kamala [Harris] administration, they are aiming to continue some of the plans that the Biden administration has already started. So defending the SAVE Plan and going towards that broad forgiveness,"" Rubin explains. The fall travel season is officially here, and over half of travelers plan to manage the cost of their trips by cutting back on other expenses, according to Hopper. Hopper lead economist Hayley Berg notes that travelers should book their travel by October 14, when they can get the best airfare prices on their holiday travel. She adds that prices for holiday travel increase after Halloween. She also encourages travelers to be flexible with their travel dates, explaining that you can save about $200 per domestic ticket just by being flexible around your Thanksgiving and Christmas travel dates. While these holidays are the cheapest travel days, she explains that Monday or Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and Monday before Christmas Eve are the other cheapest times to fly. Consumers are shopping early for the holiday season, turning to retailers offering discounts, a recent CNET survey shows. Dashia Milden, CNET money editor, explains, ""The majority of shoppers right now are planning on leaning on those early holiday sales. When we start thinking about [Amazon’s (AMZN)] Prime Day sales literally launching tomorrow. Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), you name it."" On top of looking for deals, shoppers are also cutting down their holiday spending. She tells Yahoo Finance, “The majority of shoppers are shopping early to try to take advantage of some of those savings, and they're still making sacrifices. A percentage are spending less on non-essentials, such as travel and dining. People are setting smaller budgets, even and even choosing to go ahead and get fewer gifts. So when we start looking at that, it's very clear that the holidays are important and that they're willing to make some sacrifices in the meantime.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

08/10/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Prime Day deals kick off holiday sales for consumers,"Consumers are shopping early for the holiday season, turning to retailers offering discounts, a recent CNET survey shows. Dashia Milden, CNET money editor, joins Wealth! host Brad Smith to discuss what the survey indicates about consumer behavior for the upcoming holiday season. “The majority of shoppers right now are planning on leaning on those early holiday sales. When we start thinking about [Amazon’s (AMZN)] Prime Day sales literally launching tomorrow. Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), you name it,” Milden tells Yahoo Finance. On top of looking for deals, shoppers are also cutting down their holiday spending. “The majority of shoppers are shopping early to try to take advantage of some of those savings, and they're still making sacrifices.

So when we start looking at that, it's very clear that the holidays are important and that they're willing to make some sacrifices in the meantime.” As far as savings tips, Milden says, “It really depends on what you're looking for,” but CNET’s shopping experts recommend “making sure that you are looking at the deals and comparing prices.” She adds that for October, shoppers may want to take advantage of deals on batteries ahead of the holidays. Some shoppers may find themselves tempted to buy products they see when scrolling social media, but Milden notes that these might not always be the best option. “It can be a really good deal depending on what you look for, but it could also be a slippery slope. So I just want to advise while it could be good to find that deal or find that really nice gadget, it can lead to a little bit of overspending and even debt. So just being mindful there.” For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!

Initially raised to a Category 5 in days prior, Milton has been downgraded back to a Category 4 as it nears Florida. Tampa Electric CEO and President Archie Collins told Yahoo Finance its grid restoration effort will be the ""the biggest in in our history"" in the wake of Milton. In 2022, Hurricane Ian did ""$121 billion [in damages] and it only hit Fort Myers and swampland. [Milton] is hitting Tampa, Sarasota, Disney, Cape Canaveral, I mean this is hitting a lot of assets. So we're projecting at least $121 billion [in damages],"" Weather Trends International Founder and CEO Bill Kirk tells Madison Mills and Seana Smith on Catalysts. Weather Trends International is a private company that provides weather coverage and guidance to clients such as major retailers, manufacturers, and agricultural producers. Kirk comments on what Hurricane Milton and its subsequent damages could mean for home improvement retailers such as Lowe's (LOW), Home Depot (HD), and Tractor Supply Company (TSCO), and Weather Trends International's findings on this year's weather and climate patterns. ""Q4 we think is very strong. We have a very cooler, wetter, snowier La Niña-type winter, so we think it'll be stronger. Last year was the hottest in history right, so the sales were delayed until the polar vortex hit in January last year. This year you're moving all those sales up at full price full margin product,"" Kirk says on weather predictions. ""So we're very bullish on Q4 and then we have a train wreck in 2025.

Host Brad Smith to break down his earnings season dos and don'ts as well as take a look at his artificial intelligence (AI) picks, including Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Walmart (WMT), during third quarter results. “Jumping in front of earnings, that's a no-no,” Mahoney says, adding, “That's like Russian roulette again.” He outlines, “What we like to do in our kind of playbook, as you said, is actually find those companies that beat estimates, raise guidance, and then the analysts trip over themselves.” Conversely, “stay away from the other ones,” Mahoney says, explaining that when a company reports an earnings miss and the stock takes a nosedive, “It looks cheap, [but] I'm telling your viewers that's quicksand. You’d rather go with those companies that beat and raise guidance, even if you have to pay up for it.” Mahoney says he's looking for companies he wants to buy again. “They're going to appear to be kind of expensive. They may take out the year high, but behind it is momentum. Behind it is still those analysts [who] are still playing catch up. So, to us, it separates the men from the boys, so to speak. We'll see that this earnings season as we'll see every other earnings season.” As far as specific names, Mahoney says, “We like technology because they're more consistent.” With consideration to his earnings framework and the ongoing AI trade, he says “We love Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple. All those names kind of and most of those names are going to beat raise guidance probably buy back stock” as well as “companies like Walmart who are actually using [AI] data” to boost productivity.

18/10/2024,00:00:00,WMT,"P&G CEO on earnings, outlook, and 'shrinkflation'","Procter & Gamble (PG) reported mixed first quarter earnings Friday morning. The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 surpassed the expected $1.90. However, revenue fell short of estimates, coming in at $21.74 billion, just below the anticipated $21.96 billion. Following the report, CEO and President Jon Moeller joined Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's performance. Moeller addressed a key question for the North American market: ""Can we grow meaningful unit volume at the new prices that we've moved to as a result of the commodity cost increases?"" He noted that they achieved this, with volume up 4% in the North American business this quarter. Over the last five quarters, he highlighted an average of 3-4 points of growth in the region, demonstrating ""a very strong consumer that's being offered a very good value."" Despite increased commodity costs in the region, the company has managed to sustain volume growth. Regarding the US consumer and the inflationary environment, Moeller explains, ""We try to ensure that we have offerings that are available across the price ladder for consumers who have different outlay needs."" He mentions this approach includes tailored pack offerings for budget-conscious consumers, emphasizing the company's commitment to value-driven performance. ""Our whole model depends on delighting a number of constituents: delighting consumers, delighting customers, delighting employees, delighting society, delighting shareholders. And I firmly believe that if we fail to do one of those, we will fail to do all of them,"" Moeller explains to Yahoo Finance. He goes on to add that, when it comes to small packaging sizes, ""Smaller sizes, in general, ... are more costly to produce. So it's not intuitive that you grow margin by doing that. But there are times where we will reduce the size of an offering ... because that, at times, increases affordability. So it's based on a desire to increase value, approachability, affordability of our products.""

US stocks (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) continue to climb as the bull market maintains its momentum. Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager David Wagner jobserves that the market is reaching new highs ""from different whys."" While the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech giants have driven most market gains over the past 18 months, he notes this trend is now broadening to other sectors and stocks. Wagner points to ""undervalued"" areas, such as US small caps and international stocks, which began outperforming in the third quarter. However, some volatility may lie ahead as the market enters its third year of a bull run. Initial jobless claims for the week ending on October 12 came in below estimates, falling to 241,000 against expectations of 259,000. Yahoo Finance anchor Madison Mills joins Brad Smith to break down the fresh labor print, taking into account the data distortion from recent hurricanes in southern states. According to the latest data from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), confidence among home builders rose to a four-month high in October. Jim Tobin, NAHB CEO, explains that home builder confidence is up because of falling interest rates. He tells Yahoo Finance that the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle ""is really giving our members, and our survey members in particular, a feeling that we're on the backside of the bad news and that we are looking forward to a lower interest rate environment, certainly for mortgage rates in the future, and that the market is going to come back strong."" Mortgage rates rose for the third consecutive week, according to the latest data out from Freddie Mac, pushing the 30-year fixed rate mortgage to 6.44%. Yahoo Finance senior housing reporter Claire Boston breaks the latest mortgage rates and explains the implications this has for potential homebuyers struggling to find affordable options in the US housing market. Meanwhile, retail sales topped economist expectations for September, according to the US Census Bureau, rising 0.4% month-over-month. Sucharita Kodali, Forrester Research retail analyst, explains that non-store retailers like Amazon (AMZN) are seeing the most gains. She notes that apparel has ""recovered from its pandemic depths,"" while home-related retailers are struggling as interest rates remain relatively high. StockX CEO Scott Cutler discusses trends in the resale space and what they say about consumer behavior heading into the holiday shopping season. “The state of the resale market right now is super dynamic. This year, we've probably seen the biggest shifts in market share that we've ever seen, at least in StockX's history. And you see this also reflected in the public markets. On the one side, you've got the challenges associated with Nike, which has really been driven by restocks, oversupply [and] a lack of innovation. But if you look at the price performance in the resale markets as well as market share gains, where is it happening? Adidas (ADDYY), Asics (ASCCY), Deckers (DECK), which is Hoka and Uggs, and Crocs (CROX),"" he tells Yahoo Finance. Americans continue to grapple with food price inflation, as evidenced by recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The food-at-home index rose 0.4% in September, with the meats, poultry, fish, and eggs categories experiencing a notable 0.8% price increase.

As Thanksgiving approaches, major food retailers are responding to consumers' financial concerns by introducing new holiday meal deals. Brad Smith delves into the details of these offerings, highlighting some of the top promotions from major retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Aldi. These companies are striving to deliver what they're calling an ""inflation-free holiday meal,"" helping customers enjoy their Thanksgiving celebrations without breaking the bank.

15/11/2024,00:00:00,WMT,Walmart is giving Amazon competition in e-commerce: Analyst,"The October retail sales data shows the consumer is still going strong. The Census Bureau data shows retail sales rose 0.4% in October. That was higher than the 0.3% economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg. September's headline number was also revised upwards.  LSEG Director of Consumer Research Jharonne Martis says the data point that stood out to her was the year-over-year growth in e-commerce sales. She notes that the October data benefits from Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Deal Days but adds that other retailers piggyback off that promotion and offer their own deals. ""It's telling us the consumer is still gravitating toward those online deals,"" she says. When it comes to the e-commerce business, Martis thinks Walmart (WMT) is starting to give Amazon some more competition. Why? ""They're giving the consumer the ability to shop the way they want to, whether it be ordering it on your mobile... and picking it up at the store on your way home or just having it delivered right there from the store to your house. Walmart is definitely giving Amazon a lot of competition,"" she tells Yahoo Finance.

But if we look at our research and take a step back ... We've definitely seen execution at Target become much more inconsistent,"" Mushkin says.

Bloomberg News reporter Simone Foxman provides insights into this broader corporate trend, noting that while several companies have reduced DEI initiatives, these actions have not significantly impacted stock prices. However, she highlights that investors have been sensitive to companies' handling of partnerships with LGBTQ influencers and related merchandise. ""I think the real question as we move forward is do these announcements and the curtailing of these policies change the way these companies are able to retain talent,"" Foxman tells Yahoo Finance. She emphasizes the potential long-term implications, particularly considering Generation Z's reputation as a ""more open"" and diverse community.

Its stock is up nearly 80% year to date, and sales are booming. Why? In an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explains how pre-pandemic investments are starting to pay off. ""We invested in wages for our associates. We invested in our people, things like education. We invested in lower prices, we invested in e-commerce, we invested in technology, all within a pretty tight period of time,"" he said. One thing that's helping to boost the bottom line is the type of customer Walmart (WMT) is drawing in. The company says it is increasingly attracting more higher-income consumers. McMillon thinks that convenience has been drawing a different customer base. He also discusses inflation, noting that the prices for general merchandise are falling faster than food items. A top-of-mind topic for many CEOs right now is the threat of a trade war, with President-elect Trump threatening to enact more tariffs. McMillon thinks Walmart is ""positioned to manage"" tariffs but worries that customers may see higher prices, even though the retail giant plans to ""do everything we can to try and keep them low."" There's one technology McMillon is excited about — generative AI. ""It's going to help us be more anticipatory for customers and members ... The world will look more like personal shopping assistance than it will an old-fashioned search bar with a laundry list of results that you and I then have to work through as a customer. Just saving us time, making it more convenient, helping us solve problems,"" McMillon said of the tech. Watch the video above to hear what McMillon expects for Walmart over the next 10 years.

Mills Sadat Dowlat (MSD) LLP Partner Camron Dowlatshahi joins Market Domination Overtime to share his outlook on this evolving landscape. Dowlatshahi traces the evolution of DEI initiatives following the death of George Floyd in 2020, highlighting how companies initially took ""a strong stance supporting under-represented communities."" However, he points out the political and social climate has shifted since then, with ""the fall and the rise again of the Trump administration, conservative movement, and far-right movement in the United States, and the 'anti-woke' movements again. And because of that, you see now companies catering to those populations,"" pointing to businesses like Walmart and Lowe's (LOW). Despite these shifts, Dowlatshahi asserts that ""discrimination is still discrimination."" The attorney remains hopeful that established state and federal laws will continue to protect against workplace discrimination. Although, he acknowledges a concerning trend, telling Yahoo Finance ""I have seen an increase in fear, frankly."" ""The hope is that we can stand on state and federal law that has been in place for decades and decades,"" the MSD partner concludes.

Jaggi emphasizes the remarkable resilience of US consumer spending. ""I think it really says a lot about the fact that, at the end of the day, this consumer economy keeps finding ways to engage with the consumer,"" he observes. However, Jaggi points out a shift in shopping patterns: ""We have become a value-oriented consumer society.""

This value-hunting extends online, with Jaggi noting that ""the US consumer continues to find ways to find the best bang for the dollar."" Looking ahead to 2025, Jaggi expresses optimism about the department store sector. He views Nordstrom's (JWN) announcement to go private as ""great news,"" describing the retailer as ""the gold standard"" and suggesting the move will enable better focus on long-term growth strategies.

02/04/2025,00:00:00,WMT,Tariffs are the last thing apparel industry needs: Rebecca Minkoff,"Retailers are getting swept into the black vortex that are tariff headlines from the Trump administration. Big names such as Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Gap (GAP), and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) have warned about the impact of tariffs this year on profits. In the meantime, shoppers are growing concerned about what they will be paying for spring and summer apparel once tariffs kick in. The reality is that consumers may resist the higher prices, sending retailers off to offer profit-busting discounts and earnings warnings. Luxury goods companies are by no means immune to the challenges as their results have been powered by international shoppers and a wealthy class feasting on strong stock market gains (until now). Is there any reason to be optimistic about the sector? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with noted fashion designer Rebecca Minkoff for her perspective on the state of retail. Minkoff created her company from the ground floor in the mid-2000s and has seen some of the highest of the highs and lowest of the lows in retail. Minkoff is also the author of the new book Fearless: The New Rules for Unlocking Creativity, Courage, and Success, where she aims to impart leadership wisdom to the next generation of female entrepreneurs.

03/04/2025,00:00:00,WMT,Trump tariffs send stocks spiraling! 3 things investors need to know,"At his ""Liberation Day"" spectacle at the White House Wednesday afternoon, Trump revealed a baseline tariff rate of 10% on countries that will go into effect on April 5.Additional tariffs will be added for some countries that the administration considers to be the worst offenders. Some of those alleged worst offenders are important sourcing and business regions for many large US companies such as Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE), and Walmart (WMT). China, for example, will see an estimated reciprocal tariff of 34%. Vietnam at 32%. Japan is at 24%. The news has hit stocks, with Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down about 1,200 points, or nearly 3% (YM=F). S&P 500 futures are down 3.5% (ES=F), and Nasdaq futures are off by 3.8% (NQ=F). Japan’s Nikkei (^N225) and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index (^HSI) have also registered significant losses. Here’s the hot analysis investors need to know right now:First, retail stocks are getting battered. Walmart, Nike, and Under Armour (UAA, UA) are getting slammed as steep tariffs on China could hammer profits. Nike, for example, relies on China and Vietnam for 55% of its sourcing. Stifel analyst Jim Duffy estimates Nike could see $1.69 a share in earnings wiped out this year because of tariffs. Next up, Apple is going to have a rough day: Morgan Stanley estimates that the tariffs on iPhones and other devices from China will increase Apple’s annual costs by a whopping $8.5 billion. That could hit Apple’s profits by 52 cents next year. Brutal. And lastly, the technical takedown: Market technicians are locked in on the S&P 500’s March 13 closing low of 5,527.50. At this moment, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is poised to test that low. A break through below the March lows intraday coupled with a new closing low could really damage sentiment further pros warn. RBC strategist Lori Calvasina says the S&P 500 has a clear shot to 4,900 if that low is breached.
