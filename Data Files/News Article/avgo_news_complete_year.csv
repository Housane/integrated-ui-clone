Patel expects tech leaders to maintain their outperformance, viewing it as ""a long-term trend."" However, she also highlights potential opportunities in sectors such as industrials and telecommunications. Addressing concerns about the possibility of repositioning away from tech-focused stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), Patel states, ""The problem is I don't know of another area to redeploy that has such a relatively clear, sustainable growth path to continue to have higher earnings in other sectors. That's why we stick with the tech names, the semi names. They've been fabulous names and I think they'll continue to be very, very good names.

Moor Insights & Strategy founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Morning Brief to discuss the semiconductor industry's current state. Moorhead observes that due to the chip sector's strong momentum over the past year, ""any hiccup, any rumor of something"" can trigger a stock decline. He suggests this downturn presents an opportunity for investors to identify potential high-growth companies beyond industry giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Intel (INTC). Moorhead advises investors to ""look at a mid-term and even... long-term approach of where those stocks are going or could go,"" highlighting companies such as Qualcomm (QCOM). Regarding industry trends, Moorhead notes that many companies are pivoting towards AI, often at the expense of other initiatives. ""They want their IT groups to pivot to generative AI. And a lot of this is about FOMO, it's the fear of missing out,"" he explains. This shift in focus is creating a divide in the market: ""That's why you see companies that aren't engaged in the generative AI wave are seeing very mixed results.""

Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking For A Trade to give insight into the tech sector, the AI trade, and what it means for Big Tech moving forward into the earnings season. Moorhead reiterates his thought from a previous interview: ""I really laid out a thesis that says the infrastructure build-out is going to continue for at least another year and maybe 18 months, and that's driven primarily by the downstream FOMO, or the fear of missing out, from those enterprise SaaS providers. Meta, who clearly showed that they're investing hardcore because they have to. If you are not investing in your competitors, you could be set back potentially a decade here. Moorhead is also looking at the long-term valuations of AI-adjacent software companies and chip designers like ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARM) He ends with his thoughts that Nvidia (NVDA) has ""at least another 12 months to run. We saw TSMC (TSM), where Nvidia does all of their manufacturing, they're basically sold out through 2025 and into 2026. We just heard from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta that that they're putting the pedal to the metal on this. And all of this is goodness for Nvidia.""

12/08/2024,00:00:00,AVGO,Chip stocks will regain momentum over AI demand: Analyst,"The chip sector saw a brief recovery last week after a large sell-off, with Nvidia (NVDA) once again leading the charge. Looking forward, chip stocks look to regain momentum after August volatility, but can they capture their previous heights? KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to give insight into the chip sector and how semiconductor stocks may perform as Big Tech leans harder into AI. ""I think if you look at the sell-off over the last several weeks related to the chip sector, maybe more specifically to Nvidia, I think one, you had some concerns about maybe hyper scaler CapEx [capital expenditures] getting to kind of peak levels, but I think those were largely addressed later when you had comments coming out from Microsoft (MSFT) that it's still seeing phenomenal demand on the AI front, and it's actually supply-constrained,"" Vinh says. ""The second factor is there's some concerns out there that its next-generation Blackwell product could be delayed. I wouldn't find that too surprising."" In terms of how the stock may perform, Vinh believes Nvidia will ""beat and raise, we don't think near-term demand is going to be an issue at all.""

But many more chip makers like Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Broadcom (AVGO) still have yet to report earnings. But could they have a chance at acquiring more market share in the AI chip market from Nvidia following its latest results? CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino joins Market Domination to give insight into the chip sector and how some of these chip makers may fare amidst high demand moving forward. Zino states that when you look at Marvell's non-AI business segments ""like carrier infrastructure, the consumer side of things, those enterprise networking, those businesses have declined 50 to 70% over the last two to three quarters."" ""Our view is kind of the inventory correction is kind of really played itself out at this point in time. And you're now looking at potential sequential improvement here in the July quarter and, more importantly, in the following 2 to 3 quarters,"" Zino tells Yahoo Finance. Broadcom is set to report its fiscal third quarter results next week on Thursday, September 5. Zino finds Broadcom's networking business to be ""the bread and butter"" for their semiconductor segments. ""We think that is kind of running on all cylinders. So as far as kind of the semiconductor business, AI is driving that business very well, as well as Apple (AAPL). And then the VMware side of things, they continue to exceed our expectations on both the cost-cutting side of things, as well as kind of the revenue growth trajectory,"" Zino says.

Instead, investors should pay close attention to the three-month outlook, which is more supportive of the chip industry's growth. ""More broadly in the industry, you have to remember, like currently it's been a very asynchronous cycle. Some end markets have been very bad, some of them have hit bottom, some of them are past bottoms, some of them are not,"" he says. ""I'd say things like PCs and smartphones, they're not great this year, but they'll probably grow a little bit versus versus last year. AI is clearly off the charts strong."" He explains that because of this asynchronous cycle, it's hard to look at the entire sector as a whole and make a conclusion: ""You do have to pick and choose which parts of the market you're looking at, which parts of the market you want to be playing in.""

Rasgon has an Outperform rating on Broadcom, arguing that the company has ""the second-best AI story in the space."" He highlights how Broadcom designs chips for hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META), and believes that its AI guidance this year has been ""reasonably conservative."" However, Broadcom's core business has struggled this year, which Rasgon attributes to a cyclical low hitting the chip industry. He points to Broadcom's software business, VMWare, as a catalyst for the company within the next year. ""I think there's good upside on the software. Even if you just look more broadly, I would say it's got some of the best operating metrics, margins, and free cash, and everything else in the space by a mile. And it's still very inexpensive.

Like Jensen said on the call, doing that with the highest level of compatibility with the best yields that has a positive impact on on costs and hence margins."" Looking ahead at which stock may be a great alternative to Nvidia, Moorhead claims: ""AMD (AMD) is the next best replacement, particularly because they both have GPUs followed very closely by Broadcom (AVGO), the counter to a GPU is what's called an ASIC and those are primarily, built by Broadcom.""  Read more about Nvidia's plunge here.

12/09/2024,00:00:00,AVGO,"How Oracle is giving Nvidia, other chip stocks a boost","Semiconductor stocks rallied in Wednesday's trading session after Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang highlighted ""great"" demand for AI chips. KeyBanc Capital Markets equity research analyst John Vinh joins Morning Brief to discuss the state of the overall AI race and some of the key players in the sector. After Nvidia rose 8% intraday, Vinh believes the movement indicates ""a recovery based on kind of an overreaction on earnings."" While Nvidia's most recent earnings met and beat expectations, investors were still disappointed as they looked for bigger returns. However, Vinh doesn't think the AI trade is stopping anytime soon: ""I think what really drove the recovery you're seeing more recently is that Oracle (ORCL) came out talked about very strong accelerating growth on the AI side. And they also said that their outlook for next year is going to result in a doubling of capex. So I think that's reassuring investors that the AI trade is not over yet."" He argues that Oracle is ""one of the key important reads in terms of AI hyperscaler demand and spend going forward."" He also points to AMD (AMD), Marvell (MRVL), and Broadcom (AVGO) as standout names in the ""expansive market"" and highlights Cirrus Logic (CRUS) as a lesser-known play. He calls the company a ""proxy for Apple (AAPL),"" noting that 80% of its revenue is Apple-driven. As the tech giant rolls out Apple Intelligence, Cirrus Logic will be a beneficiary, especially if it kicks off an upgrade cycle. While the AI race shows no signs of stopping, Vinh expects spending to be ""unabated"" as data centers become a crucial part of the equation. He explains, ""What we look at in our perspective, at least in the near to medium term, at least going into 2025, is that all these AI hyperscalers are going to have to aggressively spend. The next-generation platform that Nvidia is releasing, Blackwell, is going to basically lower your TCO (total cost of ownership) by 30x."" ""So if we're still waiting for that monetization model, operationally, if you're a hyperscaler, you've got to go with the lowest cost TCO solution out there until you get that monetization model. So we don't see any sort of letup in spend over the next 12 months here,"" he concludes. For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

17/09/2024,00:00:00,AVGO,Both Harris & Trump have 'unattractive' economic policies: Portfolio manager,"Advisors Capital Management partner and portfolio manager JoAnne Feeney joins Morning Brief to discuss the political outlook for small caps (^RUT) and some of her top tech plays as the market (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) gains broaden out beyond the ""Magnificent Seven."" Feeney does not expect small caps to be at risk of more fiscal policy changes this year. However, as the election remains tight between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, she argues that both sides have ""pretty unattractive policies."" She explains, ""It's unlikely that both sides of the aisle would support an increase in the corporate tax rate, no matter who gets elected. So I think that's a low-risk situation. Tariff policy is more concerning, particularly for small businesses, because a lot of the time they're sourcing their inputs from abroad and often from cheap suppliers abroad."" She points to Broadcom (AVGO) as a ""core holding"" at Advisors Capital Management and a good opportunity for investors, arguing that it has ""risen through the ranks through all the acquisitions that their leadership has made over the last several years. But it's still not as well known as, say, a Nvidia (NVDA) or some of the other bigger guys like Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN)."" She also highlights its mix of assets, from software to hardware.

26/09/2024,00:00:00,AVGO,Micron is in a 'cyclical upswing': Analyst,"Micron Technology (MU) posted fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations on both revenue and earnings. The semiconductor giant also raised its guidance for the next quarter, sparking a widespread rally in global chip markets. Morningstar Equity Analyst of Technology William Kerwin joins Morning Brief to discuss his outlook on Micron following the beat-and-raise. Kerwin acknowledges that the results ""were nothing short of impressive,"" but notes that this doesn't alter his long-term view on the company. He emphasizes that Micron is currently riding ""a cyclical upswing"" in memory demand, which he expects to continue through 2025. However, he cautions that this dynamic will eventually decelerate, suggesting that the current rally ""is a correction from too much pessimism"" from investors, even as the fundamentals remain robust. ""As much as we liked the print, [and] we like the next four quarters for Micron, we still see long-term cyclicality in the future,"" Kerwin states. He believes this cyclical nature will ultimately weigh on the share price, leading him to maintain a target of $110, despite the stock hitting that milestone on the heels of this earnings report.

03/10/2024,00:00:00,AVGO,Why auto industry woes are dragging down chip stocks,"The semiconductor sector led Tuesday’s losses, with Nvidia losing nearly $110 billion in market cap. Christopher Danely, Citi head of US semiconductor research, joins Catalysts Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss the recent weakness and what it says about the chip sector. “Semis have always been quite a volatile space. I think it's still one of the best sectors on the year in terms of performance. What happened in the last couple of days was you had this big slew of automotive data points that were very negative… [Autos represent] like 10 to 15% of the semiconductor sector. So not an insignificant part.” The chip sector is coming down from last week when Micron (MU) earnings sent chipmaker stocks higher. “Micron one of the leading AI companies, reported last week lots of upside there. Obviously, Nvidia (NVDA) [and] AMD (AMD). They've all been reporting upside. So it's like this push-pull. AI is now about 30% of semis. So that's clearly leading the charge… Semis are still up, I think, 25% [to] 30% on the year. So it's a pretty decent year. It's just there's some volatility. There's some parts that are good and some parts that are not so good.” “If you look at the AI space and where the bulk of the spending is coming from, it's the cloud companies. So the big four. That's Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META)… they're responsible for the bulk of the spending. But then you also have other companies that are starting to spend more on AI, like Tesla (TSLA).” “For investors out there, number one, you really want to look at the CapEx of what the big four cloud companies are doing. It seems like their CapEx has been moving up every quarter. That's the thing that we're going to be watching most during earnings. But then you also have other companies like Tesla that are getting into the space. But really, I would say focus on the big four and, in particular, what the outlook is for next year.” He explains that the “main AI companies in semis” are Nvidia, followed by Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD. ""You've had consistent upside from Broadcom, from Nvidia. You know that should presage very good spending by those cloud companies."" The analyst names Analog Devices (ADI) as a recent top pick as part of a strategy to “get a little more defensive really from a broader space on semis because of that volatility… Analog Devices is known as a defensive stock. Remember we're cautious on the automotive space and a couple of others.” He explains he also has Buy rating for Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom.

22/11/2024,00:00:00,AVGO,"The top AI investment opportunities beyond Nvidia, chip stocks","While Nvidia (NVDA) continues dominating the AI chip market, investors seek additional opportunities in the rapidly evolving sector. Nvidia shares continue to fluctuate since reporting third quarter earnings that beat estimates but ultimately did not outpace Wall Street's high expectations. Wedbush Securities managing director Matt Bryson highlights several promising AI-related investments beyond the semiconductor industry. Bryson says that AI includes more than just chips, recommending server manufacturers like Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Dell Technologies (DELL) as potential investment targets. For networking infrastructure critical to AI development, he spotlights Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technology (MRVL). In the data center storage segment, he points to Western Digital (WDC) and Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) as promising options. Nonetheless, Bryson emphasizes that Nvidia is a frontrunner in this space: ""It seems like they're taking their advantage in accelerators and transitioning that into owning more parts of the system, building compute, building networking, building software — and all of those shifts lock Nvidia in.""

How should investors position their portfolios in 2025? Bokeh Capital Partners founder and chief investment officer Kimberly Forrest joins Seana Smith and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share her 2025 portfolio repositioning strategy, focusing on semiconductor stocks and small-cap allocation. ""I would look at that super semiconductor space and make some adjustments,"" Forrest tells Yahoo Finance, explaining, ""It feels like semiconductors that are targeted on AI seem very overweight, and you should take a look at that."" Names like Nvidia (NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturer Company (TSM), and Broadcom (AVGO) are among some of the top year-to-date gainers in the chip space. The strategist highlights potential opportunities in small-caps with a market capitalization of at least $1 billion. ""Those mid-size companies are kind of forgotten recently and they're also misunderstood."" She adds, ""A lot of the lore on Wall Street says that mid-cap companies and small-cap companies mostly serve where they are founded in the US, and I disagree with that. I think a lot of the mid-caps are global companies... and I think those are the ones that you should be on the lookout for.""

It's just a matter of time for any of those companies who aren't doing it. Apple was obviously always involved in making their own silicon for their devices. Now, they're bringing that into the server and doing it for their particular use case in AI.

Rhodium Group director Reva Goujon joins Market Domination to discuss the growing divide. Goujon highlights recent policy initiatives like the Routers Act and the US Commerce Department's ICTS (Information and Communications Technology and Services) controls, which aim to remove Chinese components from infrastructure due to increased data and cybersecurity concerns. She notes that companies like TP-Link have become deeply embedded in US infrastructure, making this a complex challenge. ""What the US is doing is it's saying that 'look, there's a number of toolmakers out there that still want to feed into the Chinese chip market,'"" Goujon explains. She describes a new ""single chip de minimis"" provision that would extend US restrictions to any factory worldwide using even one US chip. ""So the US is basically telling partners 'do the right thing, align with us or else you're going to be subject to US law and compliance.'"" However, Goujon cautions that the immediate impact may be limited: ""The issue is that China has been able to stockpile an enormous amount of equipment, especially over the past one and a half years... and so it may take a while to even see the effects of export controls biting.""

""I wouldn't say [the current AI-related market] is necessarily a bubble, but I think you really have to be careful about just throwing money at the same old places that you did last year because technology needs different things as it rolls out, and this is going to be a longer rollout than anybody who's currently investing and has won so far, is really prepared for,"" Forrest says. She tells investors, ""Pace yourself and understand that the technology is going to mutate a little. Right now, Nvidia (NVDA) is the big winner, and they have a GPU chip, but it seems like Broadcom (AVGO) has a solution for another part of the problem, which is inference. So maybe you want to look for companies like Marvell (MRVL) and Broadcom that are doing that are adding to the solution."" Forrest notes, ""I wouldn't kick Nvidia to the curb.

Arya is also fresh off upgrading shares of ailing chipmaker Intel (INTC) amid the appointment of a new CEO in Lip-Bu Tan.
