Miller notes that bonds (^TYX, ^TNX, ^FVX) and equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) will likely benefit from the Fed's cutting cycle. ""We're playing calendar spreads when it comes to commodities, so we're not betting on the direction of commodity prices, but we're trying to earn the storage costs associated with those,"" Miller tells Yahoo Finance. ""We're also trying to pick up the differentials between yields in different countries,"" he continues. He highlights borrowing in Switzerland and Japan as good trades and says that his overall strategy is ""to play it as diversified as we can as to where we're picking up our return streams."" He expects the Fed to cut twice this year, with the first cut starting in September. As rates start to ease, he believes that ""high-margin monopolistic type businesses that have really strong tailwinds"" are poised to benefit. He specifically points to the tech sector and names like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) as examples. In addition, he highlights fintech names like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), explaining, ""if you combine inflation with more money coming through the system, combined with taking a little cut off the top of every transaction, those are phenomenal businesses as well.""

16/10/2024,00:00:00,V,What is post-earnings announcement drift and why it matters,"With the third quarter earnings season underway, Catalyst Funds senior portfolio manager David Miller sits down with Brad Smith on Wealth! to talk about why post-earnings announcement drift is so important to his earnings season strategy. Miller says he looks “for companies where they've demonstrated clear post-earnings announcement drift.” Post-earnings announcement drift, or PEAD, is the tendency of a stock to drift in the direction of earnings for a period after the results are announced. PEAD is “one of the most powerful anomalies in finance, and basically what it says is that companies that have historically beat earnings in a significant way consistently tend to continue to beat earnings, and their stocks continue to do well. [The] same goes for those that have missed earnings consistently. They continue to do poorly. So [it's] not a surprising concept that winners tend to continue winning and the losers tend to continue losing.” The portfolio manager says there are a few standout companies and industries where a PEAD has consistently occurred in recent quarters. He names the healthcare sector with companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO) climbing on weight loss drug popularity. Miller also highlights the networking space, including Arista Networks (ANET), as well as fintech companies like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).

The US economy is showing mixed trends at best as the Trump administration continues to overhaul the global trading system. First quarter GDP fell 0.3%, but is expected to bounce back slightly in the second quarter. Consumer confidence has been on a downtrend. And the world’s biggest consumer companies, including Walmart, Target, and Starbucks, have warned about sluggish spending trends by households. On the flip side, the stock market has recovered from the Liberation Day lows, which has helped to support sentiment among some households. So, where is the economy headed next, given the whirlwind of factors it’s facing? Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with Visa Chief Economist Wayne Best. Best is an economics veteran, armed with everything from insights on consumer spending from Visa (V) card swipes to the impact on the economy from the wealth effect of higher stock prices. Sozzi and Best discuss the economy’s biggest challenges and potential surprises. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.
