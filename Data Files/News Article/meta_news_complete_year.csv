03/07/2024,00:00:00,META,Big Tech-EU regulation battle is 'new chapter in an old movie',"Meta Platforms (META) is under fire by EU regulators who claim the company's ad subscription model is a pay-for-content scheme that requires users to choose between paying a fee or handing over more personal data to use for targeted advertising. Imperial College Business School professor of economics Tommaso Valletti joins Catalysts to discuss Big Tech's regulation issues in the EU. Valletti notes that the European Commission tried to use antitrust laws to curb the market power of some Big Tech companies. However, that approach moved slowly, so they decided to regulate companies under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which is a new policy that is designed to target companies identified as ""gatekeepers."" Meta was identified by the Commission as a ""gatekeeper"" and could be faced with fines for violating the Digital Markets Act in its advertising model. Companies charged under the Digital Markets Act may respond, which would kick off a regulatory dialog. Valletti says, ""I suspect that the stakes are so high because the philosophy of the European Commission is that they would like some Big Tech companies to change the business model. So in terms of Meta, it's about data collection. In terms of Apple (AAPL), they have an ecosystem which is completely closed and they want to have a revolution there. But these companies are making so much money that for them, it's better to fight on legal grounds instead of changing the business model."" He explains that fines for violating the act are more like a ""slap on the wrist"" compared to the revenue generation of Big Tech names like Apple, Meta, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL): ""Those fines don't really help at all if you want a certain conduct to be changed. And so you have to impose higher fines that DMA has the power to impose up to 10% of the global turnover. So actually this would be fines that hurt more. But then you have to go through courts to see whether this is going to happen or not. To me, it's more important, not that the fines are imposed, but the behavior of firms changes up-front because you don't want to fine people after they drive too fast. You want people to start slowing down."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

While many Wall Street firms are boosting their forecasts on the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Piper Sandler is dropping its year-end price target for the S&P 500 altogether. Piper Sandler co-chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz breaks down the call, explaining, ""If you're bullish on the S&P 500 this year for an institutional investor that's not buying the index, well, how does that really help them? Because you look at the market this year, we're up 16 [or] 17%. Typically, that much of a rally would come along with massive risk on leadership."" President Biden faces mounting calls for him to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. AGF Investments chief US policy strategist Greg Valliere notes that Democrats are in disarray over the possibility of not just another Trump presidency but the potential to lose a congressional majority and governorships across the nation. ""That would be a bloodbath for the Democrats, and that's a plausible scenario if [Biden] is still on the ticket,” he states. Because of these high stakes, Valliere believes that there is a solid chance that vice president Kamala Harris could take the reins as the Democratic nominee. The tech sector is getting bullish calls as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) shares hit an intraday high, surpassing a $1 trillion market cap. Wall Street firms are lifting their price targets on the chipmaker. Similarly, Wells Fargo lifted its price target on Meta (META) from $593 to $625 per share, citing its robust second quarter ad performance. While Big Tech continues to drive markets to new highs, former Chairman of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Tom Wheeler joins the show to discuss how Big Tech should be regulated. ""When we look at AI, we've got to recognize that all of the things that have happened in the last 12 months that have our heads spinning are probably the least amount of change that we will see in our lifetimes. And so the question becomes, how do we deal with that? How do we transform from an industrial economy that was overseen by industrial-era style regulation to a digital economy to an AI economy that has oversight to protect the public interest? And the challenge thus far is that at least in the United States, our policymakers have failed to step up to that challenge,"" Wheeler says.

The Morning Wealth welcomes Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan to talk about his outlook on the upcoming results from the remaining Magnificent Seven stocks and whether Tesla and Alphabet's results are weighing on investor confidence. McMillan points to ""a threat of more pressure"" ahead for the Magnificent Seven. He cites high valuations based on earnings growth as a key concern. ""If you don't see that earnings growth, and clearly we didn't see that with either of those two companies, that means that valuation has to come into question,"" McMillan tells Yahoo Finance. He notes that with the gap between the Magnificent Seven and the rest of the S&P 500 — commonly referred to as the 493 — being ""extremely large,"" these tech giants are tasked with performing ""incredibly well."" Regarding concerns about a potential consumer pullback affecting earnings, McMillan remains optimistic. He emphasizes that the consumer is healthy, citing robust job market conditions and continued wage growth. ""The actual purchasing power of the average worker continues to grow in a very, very healthy way,"" he states, indicating he is not worried about a decline in consumer spending.

12/08/2024,00:00:00,META,Non-Mag 7 equities are a 'once in a generation opportunity',"The ""Magnificent Seven"" Big Tech stocks are aiming to recoup losses in Monday's trading session after last week's global sell-off which significantly impacted the sector. As investors prepare for a week packed with economic and inflation data releases, questions arise about the implications for broader market trends (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC). Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein joins Catalysts to share his market outlook during this busy period for Wall Street. Bernstein identifies the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data as a key focus for investors this week. However, he emphasizes his ""fundamentally-driven"" approach rather than being ""event-driven,"" suggesting that the July CPI report won't significantly alter his market positioning. ""I think the biggest story for true fundamental investors is not so much inflation, it's not actually the Fed, it's actually earnings,"" Bernstein states. He highlights that small caps (^RUT) and emerging markets are projected to have stronger earnings growth than the Magnificent Seven in the second half of the year, calling this ""the big story that is going unnoticed right now."" Bernstein likens the current stock market dynamics to ""a see-saw."" On one side are the Magnificent Seven stocks, while ""everything else in the global equity markets"" is on the other. He suggests that the opportunities lie in the non-Magnificent Seven side, describing it as a ""once in a generation opportunity.""

To discuss the potential impact of the semiconductor giant's results on the broader tech sector (XLK), Bernstein Internet Equity Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Morning Brief. Shmulik notes that when it comes to the AI trade, tech giants have made it clear that ""the risk of underinvesting is much higher than the risk of overinvesting."" He believes that ""so long as that momentum continues,"" the entire tech sector stands to benefit. Regarding tech valuations, Shmulik observes they have cooled and ""are not demanding."" However, he emphasizes that companies must ""deliver on the core business ahead of you today"" to fund their ongoing AI investments. Notably, with companies like Alphabet's Google (GOOG, GOOGL) beginning to see returns on their AI investments, Shmulik points out that ""it's no longer talk of a theoretical, it's actually showing up in the numbers."" When it comes to investment opportunities in the AI space, Shmulik highlights Meta (META) as ""one of the cleaner names"" for those looking to participate in the AI trade.

Thill breaks down the situation with the tech giants' AI efforts: ""Microsoft told you a year ago that it would be the fastest business to $10 billion. They haven't said a peep about hitting that target. Microsoft is going to be a $250 billion dollar-plus company. That means it's a low single digit percent of their total revenue. Amazon (AMZN), they don't even break out the number. Google (GOOG, GOOGL), how is the AI product going? Well, there's no financial impact right now. Like, so Salesforce (CRM), they're not selling AI. Adobe (ADBE) it's tiny... it's tiny for everyone. "" He brings it back to Snowflake's (SNOW) current situation: ""It's not like this is Snowflake losing and everyone else is winning. No one's winning in software in AI because it's so early. There's no revenue, but there will be. And so the point is, do you want to invest?""

The AI rally has helped the broader market reach more than 37 all-time highs year-to-date. Optimists believe AI will enhance productivity and profits, leading to continued market gains. But skeptics worry about the market's reliance on a few tech giants like Nvidia.  Notably, Nvidia is not the only stock benefitting from the AI boom. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) are among the “picks and shovels” associated with the AI rally, as TSMC is responsible for actually manufacturing all the chips sold by Nvidia and other AI giants. Then there are household-name tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that are trying to bring AI applications to your home and office. It’s a big, complicated web of different players all trying to stake their claims in the AI market.  Understanding a few key terms about AI will help you suss out what companies are actually saying in their press events and earnings calls and help you make more informed decisions about which stocks you add or avoid when building your portfolio.",Yahoo,https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=95c212b021678190f2ff54887182b9ed154db2f4a2cca6a74525a56be0c1899b,1724511300

Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are projected to spend $189B in AI capital expenditures in 2024 alone. This innovation boom comes with additional costs—placing strain on aging power grids and increasing companies’ emissions as they try to hit net-zero targets. Microsoft’s emissions have increased by 30% since 2020 because of its AI investments. Companies are now working to keep up in the AI race while managing their energy footprint by investing in renewable energy sources and other zero-emission options, including nuclear. Amazon purchased a $650M data center next to a nuclear power plant run by Talen Energy (TLN) earlier this year.

It has now it has been revealed in an interview with Qualcomm's CEO that the companies are collaborating on new mixed-reality glasses. TechRadar Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff joins Market Domination to discuss this development. Ulanoff observes that the market for mixed reality headsets has proven to be ""a struggle"" for many companies. He references Apple's (AAPL) Vision Pro, noting that while the product is ""incredible,"" it likely hasn't sold the way Apple would have liked. Ulanoff points out that Qualcomm-Google's focus on smart glasses rather than a headset could potentially yield better results. As far as features, Ulanoff notes to capture consumer attention the glasses have to have two key things. First they have to be ""excellent looking,"" and secondly the display technology must allow for an ""overlaying of the world in front of you.""

""With every economic cycle, as we come out of an economic cycle, coincidentally, there's always a new tech cycle that also goes with it,"" Rangan tells Yahoo Finance. He explains that after the 2008 recession, tech companies came out with cloud products, which eventually became ""the catalyzing force for the tech industry."" He notes that for real growth, there needs to be innovation alongside economic improvement: ""It's not as easy as saying lower rates are good. I mean, they're kind of the first lift. It's the primer. The next thing, it has to be followed by real innovation."" At this moment for tech, he believes ""this game is about capital."" Cloud, just like AI, was ""capital-intensive,"" Rangan explains, and if companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE) hadn't listened to investors, he argues that they wouldn't have the massive cloud businesses they have today. He adds, ""Now we're augmenting human capital, I don't know, $20, $30 trillion? That installed base of human capital is far more valuable. That's cognition capital than compute capital. So this cycle, if done well, is going to be huge."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Goldman Sachs lead analyst Toshiya Hari is still bullish on the stock for a couple of reasons. First, he says, ""Demand for accelerated computing continues to be really strong,"" adding that it's more than hyperscalers looking to buy Nvidia's chips. Second, he thinks the company's competitive positive is still strong. He also thinks the stock has an attractive valuation and that the sell-off has been overdone. Investors have been increasingly scrutinizing the amount of money Big Tech has been spending on AI without much return on investment so far. Hari agrees that companies ""need monetization for this to be sustainable,"" but he notes hyperscalers are seeing some return on those AI investments. He adds that if a lack of monetization becomes a problem, it will affect many companies, not just Nvidia. Watch the video above to hear what Hari has to say about companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) developing their own chips.

Davidson has initiated coverage on Meta Platforms (META) — with a Buy rating and $600 per share price target — and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) — with a Neutral rating and $170 per share price target. Additionally, D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria has excluded Tesla (TSLA) in his Magnificent Seven coverage in the firm's ""compute sector,"" grouping Meta and Alphabet with Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA). On Tesla, Luria wrote “if it looks like a duck (greater than 90% of revenue from cars) and quacks like a duck (greater than 90% of profits from cars) it might just be a duck (a car company)"" in a note on Tuesday. Luria sits down with Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to talk more about his call about these tech giants and their investments in AI and computing. ""Those markets require scale, reach, and capital. So unlike previous waves of technology innovation that came from startups, innovation now is coming from... these biggest companies. So these six companies will continue to dominate in AI and spatial computing, and extend their lead from the sectors they're already in — desktop and mobile computing, cloud computing and advertising, computing,"" Luria tells Yahoo Finance. ""They'll keep dominating those and they'll dominate the next two waves."" Luria elaborates on how Meta is differentiating its AI usage and large language models from its Silicon Valley counterparts as prominent tech players continue to spend more on Nvidia chips.

Rowe Price portfolio manager Dominic Rizzo joins Market Domination to discuss how investors can best play the tech sector. Many investors were disappointed during the second quarter earnings season as they looked for significant returns on their AI plays. Rizzo expects this theme to also prevail over the upcoming tech earnings season. However, he argues, ""when I look at the return on investment for the hyperscalers and for the entire technology sector, I actually think we're starting to see it."" He points to Meta Platforms (META) as an example, explaining, ""At one point during the year, people thought that Meta would have Q4 growth rates in the mid-single digits. Now, that number is closer to 20%. And why is that? That's because they've been able to use AI to get a lot better targeting in their core advertising business."" He also believes that Apple (AAPL) will see the beginning of an upgrade cycle as it offers AI capabilities on its iPhone 16 series. In addition, he argues that Nvidia (NVDA) is in the best position as the company is ""selling the linchpin technology to all of these vendors."" While the Magnificent Seven has been under pressure, Rizzo tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think the divergence that we've seen amongst the Magnificent Seven, and between the Mag Seven and the S&P 493, is really quite natural."" Rizzo notes that the Magnificent Seven has historically grown earnings at a rate of 50 to 100% faster than the rest of the S&P 500. He expects that to continue over the medium term, especially as many of the Magnificent Seven players are well-positioned for AI. However, at this moment, he explains that they are trading only at a 50% premium to the rest of the market, making them cheaper based on a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio. He finds AI will continue to drive innovation and push further growth in mega-cap tech names. With this dynamic at play, Rizzo expects the AI chip market to grow to $400 billion by 2027.

24/10/2024,00:00:00,META,What do Tesla and IBM earnings signal about Big Tech next week?,"IBM (IBM) shares are under pressure after releasing mixed third quarter results showing artificial intelligence (AI) and software growth with weakness in other areas. Tesla (TSLA) stock is on the rise after the electric vehicle (EV) maker kicked off “Magnificent Seven” earnings. With Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL) earnings on deck, Synovus Trust senior portfolio manager Daniel Morgan joins Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss whether IBM or Tesla earnings are a better indicator of what investors should expect of Big Tech earnings. Morgan explains that IBM’s earnings were mixed but ultimately supported the AI story, “The IBM number wasn't bad. They obviously missed on revenues. But I think the expectations coming into that third quarter report were extremely elevated … It's really kind of a mixed report because they did say they generated about $3 billion in revenues directly from generative AI, and of course, everyone's really focused on that.” While IBM’s mixed results send the stock lower, Tesla, which also reported mixed results, soars. Morgan says he thinks of Tesla as being “kind of clumped into” the Magnificent Seven group. “Personally, I don't see how Tesla fits into that group. To me, they're an automaker, but they seem to be rolled into the tech group.” He notes that the positive reaction to Tesla’s earnings adds to the “good momentum” that comes into Big Tech's earnings. Big Tech earnings offer insights into how companies are spending on tech and their macro-level outlook. Morgan says that macroeconomic conditions continue to affect Big Tech spending as companies cut tech spending during heightened recession fears. He adds that the IBM report did have “some indication” of a slowdown of tech spending, with the IBM CEO saying, “One of the reasons why they fell up short in their consulting segment was the fact that CIOs are using money that would have been designated for consulting, and they're moving that into AI. They're not populating both. So we are seeing little bits of evidence that we may see some slowdown.” To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalysts here.

Ayako Yoshioka, Wealth Enhancement Group senior portfolio manager, joins Morning Brief to discuss what these results mean for the rest of the Magnificent Seven earnings and overall market leadership heading into 2025. Yoshioka explains that there is a greater emphasis on tech sector earnings given its concentration in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and weight within the Magnificent Seven. However, she notes that CapEx (capital expenditures) spending among hyperscalers will determine their leadership position moving forward. She tells Yahoo Finance, ""I think they're going to evaluate it at some point and see whether or not they need to continue at the pace that they've been at over the last few quarters."" With AI still being early in its development, Yoshioka argues that it's ""going to be a while"" before seeing real competition among hyperscalers and chip companies.

Next week, five of the “Magnificent Seven” names — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL) — are reporting quarterly earnings. “That's obviously a huge deal, not just for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and related indexes, but also for the S&P 500 (^GSPC),” the strategist says, noting that the results could feed the “debate back and forth between, are we going to get a more cyclical kind of rebound because the economy is stronger or more of that kind of defensive growth trade that we've seen really over the last 18 months.” On top of continued third quarter earnings results, the market will also get new data that could provide insight into the state of the US economy and the Federal Reserve’s next move at the November meeting. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Tuesday with fresh non-farm payroll data on Friday, November 1. Investors will also get the first cut of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the third quarter of 2024 on Wednesday. Amid uncertainties, Hill says he does expect markets to go higher. “There's a lot of reasons to worry,” like rates staying higher for longer and the election, among other factors, but “really when we cut through a lot of that noise, we focus on the primarily on the health of the underlying economy, because that's going to drive earnings and ultimately that's going to dictate the path for risk assets.

Despite the strong showings, capital expenditures (CapEx) on artificial intelligence (AI) are spooking some investors. Bernstein internet equity research analyst Mark Shmulik tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon ""feels like kind of the name that you can put money to work in and get excited about."" Alphabet also reported a positive third quarter, but Shmulik notes ongoing legal issues — especially in the antitrust arena — for Google that could hold the company back: ""There's just a whole bunch of noise around the name that's really hard to break through."" In terms of Meta, Shmulik also thinks the socail media giant is positioned well, but that when it comes to AI spending, ""we're still waiting to see just how big that spending is going to be and over what duration we could expect the return."" Shmulik goes on to explain his Underpeform rating on Reddit (RDDT). Watch the video above to hear Shmulik's take on big tech and other internet stocks.

The decision comes as Big Tech companies have turned to nuclear energy to power their artificial intelligence (AI) data centers, stoking some worries about the recent rally in nuclear energy stocks. ClearView Energy Partners managing director Timothy Fox joins Asking for a Trend Host Josh Lipton to discuss what the news means for Big Tech's nuclear push. ""Ultimately, we think the Federal Energy Regulatory [Commission] decision is a short-term setback for generators that wish to co-locate their load or co-locate their power with a data center and also a setback for the data center developers. But the order may not represent a long-term risk. It's more that FERC may have punted or didn't want to set a precedent about co-location."" Fox outlines, ""Regulators are concerned about three things. They're concerned about reliability, taking in existing large nuclear power plants offline. Does that create reliability risks? They're also concerned about ratepayers. Do existing ratepayers have to pay some unfair portion of the cost of upgrading the grid to accommodate a new data center? And then also the third concern is policy. Does the influx of new data centers create a concern about being able to meet state or local decarbonization policies?""

Roth Capital Partners managing director and senior research analyst Rohit Kulkarni tells Morning Brief hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills that other social media platforms would naturally benefit from the elimination of TikTok, which says it has 170 million monthly active US users. “I would expect shares in Snap (SNAP) to rise the most and then shares in Meta (META) to rise as well. But having said that, what happens in January and what happens to TikTok stands as far as appeals and the next steps in the legal process, that remains to be seen,” Kulkarni says. “That's what further complicates the scenarios, and whether Trump and [Elon] Musk together, how they work with TikTok in the future.” Musk is the owner of X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. In addition to the new administration set to take power in January, ByteDance is expected to appeal this decision, which could head all the way to the Supreme Court. “In my opinion, there is a scenario that TikTok would still be around come [February 1], working alive and well in the US So there is a that could again reverse some of the gains in the social media stocks that we might see when it comes to just this back and forth and uncertainty,” Kulkarni says.

Key Advisors Wealth Management CEO and co-founder Eddie Ghabour joins Catalysts Co-Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills to discuss how investors should position their portfolios with the Fed's next moves in mind. Ghabour is paying special attention to two Magnificent Seven stocks: Meta (META) and Nvidia (NVDA). ""We're actually buying cyclicals. We've increased small caps. We've increased our exposure to Meta and Nvidia,"" Ghabour tells Yahoo Finance. While he is buying Nvidia now, Ghabour goes on to say that once things reach a peak, it will be one of the first names he sells. ""When we start to see a top or what we believe is a top, we are going to sell the most aggressive holdings in the most highly owned holdings. We love Nvidia as a company and as a stock, but that will be one of the first things we cut because that will take a very big hit in our opinion.""

03/01/2025,00:00:00,META,Can the Magnificent 7 keep dominating in 2025?,"In 2024, tech stocks, especially the ""Magnificent Seven,"" led in market gains. However, a key question for 2025 remains: Can the Magnificent Seven continue outperforming in 2025? Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, joins Madison Mills and Brad Smith on Morning Brief to share his 2025 outlook on the Magnificent Seven and broader market trends. O’Rourke notes that Tesla's vehicle delivery underperformance in the fourth quarter could be a useful reality check for investors in terms of Magnificent Seven stocks as a whole. Despite Tesla's 2024 market gains, O'Rourke suggests, ""You don't have to come out of the market, but you should be looking elsewhere for a little more, you know, protection, a little more value cushion."" He elaborates, noting that the tides are changing within the Magnificent Seven, which could make those stocks less reliable. He warns, ""The problem with the entire [Magnificent Seven] is they collectively trade about 50 times trailing earning, so they're expensive as a group ... people are paying a premium for those large names, so they don't represent any type of value or protection."" Instead, O'Rourke suggests diversifying into mid- and small-cap stocks, which he believes can add more value. ""We're making a single bet on this handful of mega caps that are going to drive everything ... as a long-term investor, you want to be buying things that represent value, that are going to be good for the next several years.""

Gautam Mukunda, Yale School of Management executive fellow and author of ""Picking Presidents,"" joins Market Domination Overtime to analyze the growing corporate support for Trump's second term. Mukunda asserts that companies are being pragmatic in their support for Trump, pointing out Trump's historical willingness to use federal government power against those he perceives as political enemies or threats. He references Trump's previous conflicts with Jeff Bezos during his first term, when Trump targeted Bezos over his ownership of the Washington Post. Mukunda observes, ""Trump is very transactional, and these companies are making a transaction."" However, he warns, ""When you have said 'I will pay up if you threaten me,' the incentive you have created is to keep threatening you in order to get more payouts,"" adding that these companies ""will learn the hard way.""

She notes the popular social media app's 200% year-over-year growth in traffic. ""It captures your attention with the content and the algorithm, and through personalization, it drives you through the funnel to get you to convert,"" Tipograph says. ""So it's the power of the entire marketing funnel that exists within TikTok. You find some of that in Meta, you find some of that in Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) but TikTok is the whole story."" Tipograph notes if the Chinese-owned app is banned, Alphabet could see the biggest gains in ad revenue, while e-commerce platforms like Amazon (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), and Walmart (WMT) could benefit from TikTok Shops' potential loss.

The social media platform pleads its case before the January 19 deadline for the divest-or-ban to take effect. CNET technology reporter Abrar Al-Heeti joins Brad Smith on Wealth to discuss what users should expect as a TikTok ban looms. ""Come January 19th, if TikTok gets banned, it's not going to magically disappear from your device,"" Al-Heeti explains. ""Instead, you won't be getting updates, which means that over time, it becomes more laggy and then eventually unusable."" She notes that Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google will be fined if TikTok and updates are available on their app stores. Al-Heeti suggests saving videos on your that you want to keep, whether you posted them or another user, from the platform. She adds that Meta's (META) Instagram Reels have been a ""strong TikTok competitor"" and could be an alternate platform for users to shift to, while Snapchat (SNAP) could be another option.
