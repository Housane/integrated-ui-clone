Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley analyzes investor expectations for these reports. AI developments are projected to increase demand for some Big Tech names: ""The cloud providers, including Microsoft (MSFT), of course, will probably see demand for their cloud go up thanks to AI,"" explains Ali Mogharabi, WestEnd Capital Management's senior equity analyst. PayPal (PYPL) is also drawing investor attention after reporting second quarter earnings that beat expectations on both revenue and profit. Central banks around the world, including the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England, are gathering for policy meetings. The Federal Reserve begins its two-day meeting today, where it will decide whether to hike, cut, or maintain current interest rates. While many investors are hoping for an interest rate cut by the central bank, Yahoo Finance Fed reporter Jennifer Schonberger breaks down what to expect from the meeting. In the airline sector, Delta is still dealing with the CrowdStrike fallout and is considering legal action, according to CNBC reports. Meanwhile, JetBlue reported second quarter earnings that beat expectations on both revenue and profit.

While Moeller does not doubt that some shoppers have been ""more cautious,"" he notes that P&G data, such as the volume share of private labels, which tracks ""trade down in our categories,"" is ""unchanged"" when compared to pre-pandemic periods and the last couple of quarters. For China and the state of its consumers, Moeller comments: ""It's slow. We have very strong expectations for the mid-term and the long term, but we have accepted the short-term reality that things are going to be slower than they were from a growth standpoint, certainly, than pre-COVID. So, for example, in the quarter we just completed, a big driver of the numbers we talked about was, in fact, China, where sales were down 9%.""

18/10/2024,00:00:00,PG,"P&G CEO on earnings, outlook, and 'shrinkflation'","Procter & Gamble (PG) reported mixed first quarter earnings Friday morning. The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 surpassed the expected $1.90. However, revenue fell short of estimates, coming in at $21.74 billion, just below the anticipated $21.96 billion. Following the report, CEO and President Jon Moeller joined Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's performance. Moeller addressed a key question for the North American market: ""Can we grow meaningful unit volume at the new prices that we've moved to as a result of the commodity cost increases?"" He noted that they achieved this, with volume up 4% in the North American business this quarter. Over the last five quarters, he highlighted an average of 3-4 points of growth in the region, demonstrating ""a very strong consumer that's being offered a very good value."" Despite increased commodity costs in the region, the company has managed to sustain volume growth. Regarding the US consumer and the inflationary environment, Moeller explains, ""We try to ensure that we have offerings that are available across the price ladder for consumers who have different outlay needs."" He mentions this approach includes tailored pack offerings for budget-conscious consumers, emphasizing the company's commitment to value-driven performance. ""Our whole model depends on delighting a number of constituents: delighting consumers, delighting customers, delighting employees, delighting society, delighting shareholders. And I firmly believe that if we fail to do one of those, we will fail to do all of them,"" Moeller explains to Yahoo Finance. He goes on to add that, when it comes to small packaging sizes, ""Smaller sizes, in general, ... are more costly to produce. So it's not intuitive that you grow margin by doing that. But there are times where we will reduce the size of an offering ... because that, at times, increases affordability. So it's based on a desire to increase value, approachability, affordability of our products.""

Fiscal First Quarter Highlights For the quarter ended on September 30th, P&G reported net sales dropped 1% to $21.74 billion Putting away foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, organic revenue grew 2% helped by higher prices.

19/10/2024,00:00:00,PG,"Netflix, Procter & Gamble earnings, CVS CEO shakeup: Morning Brief","On today's episode of Morning Brief, Hosts Seana Smith and Brad Smith analyze the market open and discuss some of the biggest stories of the trading week. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) popped at the start of Friday's session, shooting 0.5% higher while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell into negative territory. Netflix (NFLX) reported better-than-expected third quarter results, sending the streaming giant’s shares higher and fueling bulls' confidence. Citi managing director Jason Bazinet tells Yahoo Finance, “The fundamentals were really good, so there's nothing really to pick out there. What I'm a little bit nervous about is what I would just call the sort of shifting bull case on the stock."" He explains that the bar keeps getting higher for the bull case of the stock with accelerating multiple expansion. Procter & Gamble (PG) reported mixed first quarter earnings Friday morning. The company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.93 surpassed the expected $1.90. However, revenue fell short of estimates, coming in at $21.74 billion, just below the anticipated $21.96 billion. Following the report, CEO and President Jon Moeller joins Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the company's performance. Moeller addresses a key question for the North American market: ""Can we grow meaningful unit volume at the new prices that we've moved to as a result of the commodity cost increases?"" He notes that they achieved this, with volume up 4% in the North American business this quarter. Mega-cap tech stocks, which are part of the Magnificent Seven, will kick off earnings season with Tesla (TSLA) to report third quarter earnings results next week. With speculation forming around the Federal Reserve's future interest rate moves, JonesTrading Chief Market Strategist Michael O'Rourke breaks down what it means for small-cap (^RUT) stocks. ""Regardless of the fact that we have a pretty strong economy right now, Q3 GDP looks like it's going to be above 3%. So that all plays to the small-cap rotation. Basically, in the high interest rate environment, you saw a lot of investors flock to the Mag seven names because they had size and safety,"" O'Rourke tells Seana Smith and Brad Smith. According to a Wall Street Journal report, OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT) have engaged an external adviser to determine the equity stake Microsoft will receive for its $14 billion investment in OpenAI. This evaluation comes as OpenAI transitions from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation. Santosh Rao, Manhattan Venture Partners head of research explains, ""I think you're going to see a lot of this back and forth going on because this whole space is really developing... But I don't think in the end, it's a too huge market, too important a technology to get it into their ecosystem. So there will be compromises. There will be some arrangement. But at the end of the day, you're going to see this because it's a high-stakes game going on in AI, so these kinds of battles do happen — especially in the initial stages that we are in,"" Rao tells Yahoo Finance. CVS Health (CVS) CEO Karen Lynch will be replaced by longtime executive David Joyner following extended profit struggles, according to the Wall Street Journal. CVS shares fell by over 6% in Friday's pre-market session.

Barclays Managing Director and US Cosmetics, Household & Personal Care analyst Lauren Lieberman joins Market Domination to share insights on how consumer-facing companies are preparing for this economic uncertainty. She notes that while consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble (PG) have adapted by localizing supply chains, others like Colgate-Palmolive (CL) still rely on global networks.
