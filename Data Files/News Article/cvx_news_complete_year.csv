03/08/2024,00:00:00,CVX,Hess focus is 'an overhang' for Chevron: Portfolio manager,"The energy sector is in focus as ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) both reported second-quarter earnings. ExxonMobile beat expectations on both revenue and profit, reporting revenue of $93.06 billion, surpassing estimates of $87.75 billion. Adjusted earnings also exceeded projections, coming in at $2.14 per share versus the expected $2.03. Chevron saw mixed results, topping revenue estimates with $51.18 billion against projections of $50.31 billion, while adjusted EPS fell short at $2.56, missing the estimated $2.93. Tortoise portfolio manager Brian Kessens joins Catalysts to discuss his outlook on each company following their respective reports. Kessens notes that Exxon beat their production estimates while also outperforming on their ""three larger horses that they're betting on"" for long-term growth. These include their legacy Permian position, the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, and their Guyana assets. Kessens states he ""really like[s] what Exxon is doing."" On the other hand, he points out that Chevron experienced ""unplanned downtime"" in their production this quarter, falling short on numerous international operations. With the Hess (HES) acquisition being a significant focus at Chevron, Kessens describes it as ""an overhang"" for the company. ""I think from a business perspective, their best [bet] is to keep their head down, fight through and execute on their existing business, and try to put the Hess acquisition to the side as they focus on that,"" he told Yahoo Finance.

Similarly, the oil and gas company also saw record production in Guyana, contributing to its second quarter earnings growth. Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells joins Market Domination to discuss both of these operations and how they play into the overall outlook of the company. ""As we look at the combined now Pioneer-Exxon Mobil Permian operations, we see even more opportunities for synergies there which we're getting out in front of already. And so just as an example, Pioneer has a remote logistics operations that Exxon Mobil has now taken on and added into our remote wells and completions operations in order to drive more synergies across logistics and procurement. We are starting to utilize what is a very large water recycling infrastructure in the Midland Basin that Pioneer brings to the table,"" Mikells says of the merger. She notes that with Pioneer, Exxon has been able to further its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint and that there are more opportunities for synergies ahead. Meanwhile, Hess (HES) shareholders approved an acquisition by Chevron (CVX) despite a dispute over Exxon's claim of a right of first refusal over Hess's Guyana assets. Mikells explains that the company feels ""really good about the arbitration panel timeline,"" explaining that it is a situation that warrants ""people to take time in order to really inform all the data and all the circumstances to interpret the joint operating agreement."" A hearing is slated toward the end of May in 2025, with a final ruling to come by September 2025. Mikells adds, ""if for some reason we were not successful in affirming the preemption that we have, our expectation would be that the Chevron-Hess transaction would move forward. But in the next breath, I would tell you we feel very good about our position in this arbitration being one of the parties that actually negotiated the agreement that's being discussed in the arbitration.""

EquitySet CEO Tony Zipparro joins Yahoo Finance to discuss three sectors to watch ahead of the election, including energy, technology, and consumer discretionary. ""If we're looking directly on themes and kind of motifs we can pull out of elections,"" Zipparro says, ""you look for the overlap, the Venn diagram of what is to avoid or consider in either candidates' case. And so when you look at policies… you look at domestic… and you look at innovation… you take those and you can kind of sprinkle it through any sector you want to look for good finds… or finds that may be positioned poorly based on what the policy comes to be."" He thinks it makes more sense to pick individual stocks instead of a basket of stocks. In energy, Zipparro's top picks are Chevron (CVX), NextEra Energy (NEE), Dominion Energy (D), and Tesla (TSLA), while some names to avoid are Peabody Energy (BTU) and Chesapeake Energy (CHK). In tech, some names Zipparro says to consider are Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). ""It's really... looking at domestic. Most semis have a large exposure to international supply chain production, manufacturing, something. And so that's where I think you look at innovation because the domestic picture isn't as clear,"" Zipparro notes. In consumer discretionary, Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Columbia Sportswear (COLM), and Yeti (YETI) are among Zipparro's top picks. ""I think it's buying into those that are domestic... or manufacture and produce more in the US,"" Zipparro says.

Nelson notes that oil demand continues to be strong ""across the globe,"" identifying two key macro factors driving the oil market at this time. ""I think you see demand coming back to traditional growth levels. So coming out of the pandemic, there was a bit of an extra boost. Everybody kind of catching up on their travel and markets coming back to normal,"" Nelson states. ""And then you see uncertainty in the market. You see... OPEC+ to some degree controlling supply. And questions about geopolitics. That's kind of keeping us in a range, but keep us bouncing around."" Addressing Chevron's M&A activity and the arbitration delays in its closing its deals with Hess (HES), Nelson highlights Chevron's growth profile, calling it ""really exciting"" and emphasizing that the Hess deal was not a necessity to maintain that growth. He notes the company has ""growth built in"" for both the short-term and long-term: ""There's a growth trajectory with or without the Hess transaction, but we believe the Hess transaction is good for both shareholders.""

09/10/2024,00:00:00,CVX,Why investors should hold energy plays amid Mideast tensions,"Amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — notably between Israel and Iran — oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) have been experiencing fluctuations with an overall upward trend. To explore the implications for the broader energy sector, Truist Securities Managing Director of Energy Neal Dingmann shares his insights on Market Domination. Dingmann observes a ""bit more risk-off"" sentiment within the energy sector, noting an increasing bearish attitude among investors towards oil. However, he cautions that if Middle Eastern tensions were to intensify, the impact on oil prices could be ""very quick and quite severe,"" potentially triggering an immediate 10 to 15% surge in prices. Despite this uncertainty, Dingmann advises investors to maintain their positions in energy stocks. ""To me, the reason to hold the group is it's hard to find a sector where you see better shareholder return in the form of bulk dividends and buybacks than you do in the energy stocks these days,"" adding that he is ""cautiously optimistic"" on the sector.

On Market Domination, Tortoise senior portfolio manager and managing director Rob Thummel discusses the valuation of top energy companies while addressing the mantra behind Republican leaders and President-elect Donald Trump's stance on US oil, better known as ""Drill, baby, drill."" ""We have a significant amount of reserves across the US. And so what? Drill, baby drill means to me is that when we need it, we'll be able to drill more and produce more,"" Thummel explains. ""But the goal will be to keep inflation moderated, and keep oil and natural gas prices at moderate levels so that they just don't get out of control."" Thummel also highlights that geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran under a Trump 2.0 administration could put a further strain on oil pricing: “If you sanction Iran then and actually apply the sanctions, you're going to have a basically less oil supply because the result will be lower exports of crude oil from Iran — which basically takes supply off of the market.""
